1,"I have been fortunate enough to play  lacrosse with both of my brothers throughout college. With me being the oldest of 3 boys within 4 years, we grew up always playing together regardless of the sport. I played with my middle brother Colin for 2 of my undergrad years at the University of Maryland. With the extra year of eligibility due to COVID cancelling out freshman years, I decided to use it to go to grad school at ND and play with my youngest brother Gavin since he is a freshman here currently. Its super special to me and I cant wait for the spring!",Lacrosse,5
2,On Sunday's after our game on Saturday some of the Offensive Line comes over to my house with my roomate and watch NFL football for a good 4/7 hours. We bring 3 TVs out into the living room and watch the NFL games and NFL Redzone. We also usually play multiple rounds of Sports Trivia against or with eachother to see how many we can get right. This is a very enjoyable time for me and my.buddies has we take out mind off of school and our football team and watch the sport we love while also playing hundreds of rounds of sports trivia. ,Football,5
3,"When I was working as a ballboy for the Tigers, I was working in the right field.  I almost got ran over by Yasiel Puig, who was the right fielder for that game.  Someone hit a high fly ball and I was mesmerized by it.  All of a sudden I hear someone yelling ""watch out kid"", I look around me and I see Yasiel rounding the ball and I jump out of the way because he was at least 2 feet from me and it would've been a huge collision.

4,"My first tennis tournament I played was when I was 8 years old. I played at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, RI. The cool thing about this tournament was that the surface is on grass. I ended up playing on the stadium court at the facility  and lost miserably all day. But, I remember feeling so proud and accomplished by the end that it made me want to keep going. ",Tennis,5
5,"The best sports story I have is when I got my first career hit during my junior year. During January  of my sophomore year I tore my Achilles before the season started. Therefore after having COVID ruin my 2020 season, my 2021 season was over before before it started. 
So after two rough years of no playing time I was really frustrated and really excited to play. 
Finally during the third game of the season I got my first start at DH.  During my first two at bats I was hit by a pitch but finally when I came up for my third at bat I hit a line drive into Right Field for my first hit. 
I felt so happy but also relieved to get this milestone.  ",Baseball,5

Once upon a sunny summer day, I found myself at a local baseball field, surrounded by the sound of cheering fans and the smell of freshly cut grass. The game was an intense playoff matchup between two rival teams, each vying for a spot in the championship. As I watched from the stands, the tension in the air was palpable. The score remained tied until the bottom of the ninth inning, when the home team, trailing by one run, loaded the bases. The batter stepped up to the plate with two outs, and the entire crowd held its breath. With a swing that seemed almost poetic, he sent the ball soaring over the outfield fence, turning a certain loss into an unforgettable victory. The stadium erupted in a chorus of cheers, and I witnessed the power of sports to unite people in a moment of exhilarating triumph. It was a day when a simple game of baseball became a story of resilience and the sheer joy of winning against the odds. However, the outfield threw his mit up and caught the ball. The crowd was defeated.",Baseball,4
7,"In my second year of undergrad, I watched my team lose a football game to a team they were favored by over 20 points to beat because Marco Wilson decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and throw a shoe. Cade York also hit a 58 yard field goal in the most dense fog I have ever seen in my life because course he did. The combination of these two events ruined what was otherwise a great game that was a lot of fun to watch. I guess the game can still be considered a classic, but my team lost so of course it isn't. I have seen some heartbreakers in sports (Lightning getting swept in 2019 in the first round after having a record setting season, Notre Dame losing on the last play of the game to Ohio State at home, the Bucs falling short of a massive comeback against the Rams in 2021), but that shoe throw will always hurt me. Florida being seemingly unable to beat LSU does not help my feelings either.",football,1
8,"One of my favorite sports memories was when the Cubs won the World Series in 2016. The final play was one I will not forget. The batter hit the ball to Kris Bryant and as he was slipping he threw the ball to Anthony Rizzo the first baseman. This was the play that brought a championship to Chicago for the first time in a long time. The best part was when Anthony Rizzo put the ball in his back pocket to forever remember the moment. The 2016 World Series will be one to remember for everyone the Cubs came back from being down 3-1. It was thought as impossible, but the Cubs were able to do it! ",Baseball,4
9,"My freshman year in college we played Northwestern for our second game. They were ranked #3 and we were ranked #11; every media account picked Northwestern for the easy win, but we knew what we were about to do. We did not allow the noise of the media to bother us, but chose to focus on ourselves and the job we had to do.  It was a Friday night, Valentines day, and hands down one of my favorite games I have ever played I was so excited going into such a big game, being that this was my first real competitive game in college. We ended up winning, pulling off the huge upset. Parents, family and friends all came for the big game, the support was unreal and they made atmosphere feel like a home game. That is when we knew we were going to be a special team, and we ended up jumping in the rankings to #2. Thinking about that game puts an immediate smile on my face because that was one of the last games I got to play with our special 2020 team, that was unfortunately cut short a few weeks later. This is an amazing memory I like to hold on to from a not so amazing time. Our 7 game season in 2020 will always hold a special place in my heart.",lacrosse,5
10,"My favorite sports story is winning the individual Illinois High School State Championship for golf my senior year of high school. I finished runner-up the previous year and had won every regular season golf tournament that year so the expectations were high. The first day of State was 35 degrees and raining which turned to snow by the back nine. I was having an amazing round. I shot a bogey free 67 and had a five shot lead heading into the final round. Everything was so easy during the first day. The second day, I played fine until hole 15 where I had a double bogey because I hit it into a penalty area. From there, I had a one shot lead with three holes to play. The last hole was the toughest on the course. It was a long par 4 with water and several bunkers. I hit a good tee shot but had a five hybrid into the green. It came up just short and went into the front bunker. I had to get up and down from the bunker to win the state title. The sand was very compacted but I clipped it nicely and hit it 4 feet behind the hole. I had a downhill four footer that broke left to right with every state golfer and parent surrounding the green. I made the putt right in the center and won the state title. It was one of the greatest feelings of my life. ",Golf ,5
11,"In January 2021, the University of Michigan athletics department was shut down because of a new COVID variant entering the country. The teams at Michigan had 20% of the total cases in the US so they stopped us from training and competing in order to stop the spread. This sounds like a good solution but for the swim team, there was a big issue. We have the Big Ten Championships in three weeks and we weren't going to be allowed to train for two of them. 

The two weeks of being shut down were very difficult. We had to keep training in order to swim well at the meet so we took lifting equipment from the weight room to lift at home. We also took a spin bike. We went on seven mile runs in the freezing temperatures and even found a heated outdoor pool to swim in for 45 minutes a day. It wasn't ideal but it was the most determined I had ever been to keep training. 

When we got to Big Tens, I was very unsure about how I was going to swim but I was confident I did everything I could with the circumstances. I got placed on the first relay of the meet and we ended up winning and becoming Big Ten Champions. Two days later I qualified individually for my first NCAA Championships.",Swimming,4
12,"When I was a senior in high school my football team, the Walton Raiders, played the North Gwinnett Bulldogs in a televised game on ESPN U. It was a close game, and we were down by 4 with about 2 minutes left to play when we took the field for our final drive. I was the starting left tackle on the offensive line, and on a crucial third down I gave up the worst sack of my football career. I caused us to loose 15 yards on national television. I was horrified. Somehow we were able to make an amazing play on 4th down to save the drive, and hope lived on. We neared the goal line. It was 2nd and goal from the 6 yard line, and the play call was a sweep to the left side. We handed the ball off, and in a glorious act of redemption I opened a clear lane to the endzone by blocking two defenders at the same time. My previous transgressions were forgotten as the crowed erupted in a thunderous roar, and relief washed over me. The Walton Raiders emerged victorious, and I saved myself from a lifetime of embarrassment.",Football,5
13,"One my favorite personal sports stories is my 2023 season. I am a transfer student here, but before Notre Dame I played lacrosse at University of Michigan. In the 2022 year our team went 7-8, but in the 2023 season we were able to turn it all around and win the Big Ten Championship. We were not expected to this at all and we were projected to be the last seed in the Big Ten. On top of that we were also the first University of Michigan Men's Lacrosse to win the Big Ten Championship, and also go on to the NCAA tournament. In the tournament we won the first round. ",lacrosse,5
14,"May 2023 Mens lacrosse won our first National Championship in program history. Being a part of this team and this game was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. It was unbelievable. The energy of the stadium, and feeling when the clock ticked down was indescribable. Being there with that team was a memory I will never forget, and something that I've always dreamed of.",Lacrosse,5
15,"When I was 14 I won nationals and made the national team, I was really excited to start competing internationally and succeeding more in my sport. A couple months after that I was warming up on a trampoline before practice and fell, breaking my arm and dislocating my shoulder at the same time. I had to get surgery to fix my broken elbow and I got two external rods inserted. On top of that I had to rehabilitate my shoulder so that I could gain my strength back. I was also dropped from the national team. I was terrified to go back to practice and even thought about not returning at all. Luckily I pushed myself to get back after two years and thanks to it I've been able to have a successful college career of high diving with no shoulder or elbow pain. ",Diving,4
16,"I played soccer for my junior high throughout the entire time when I was there. After I graduated, I was told by my previous teachers a piece of hearbreaking news that my junior high decided to disband the soccer program due to the budget limit. Many students who were aspiring about playing soccer now did not have the opportunities to participate in this beautiful sport. Therefore, I decided to take some actions by initiating a free soccer training program at my junior high. I negotiated with school for the field and facility while sending out flyers to recruite students. Eventually, I successfully recruited 20 students and organized more than 30-40 training sessions in the span of two years. It was an amazing experience and journey for me, as I did not only contribute back to my alma mater and I continued students' passion in playing soccer. One of my students managed to get into the academy of a semi-professional team in my city, which was one of my proudest moments.",Soccer,5
17,"We were playing Central Michigan in football this season and by no means was expecting to go in at any point this game, we already had our blowout game against Tennesse State in which majority of the team got in, especially all the older guys on the team. But we were up by more than 20 with less than a 2 minutes left and none of the real running backs wanted to go in and get any more carries. Luckily all three of the walk-on running backs were more than happy to go fight for absolutely useless yards. It was third down and long with the last rep of the real running backs playing and we ran a screen play and the DE on that side retraced but luckily Devyn Ford was able to catch the ball and get the first down. Each one of the three walk-on running backs got a carry. I got in on the 3 & 2 and just about blacked out at this point. I ran blue dive and ended up falling forward through a shoulder pad of a d-lineman and getting the first down. At this point I completely blacked out until the point we were signing the almater and it hit that I just got my 2nd first down for the University at Notre Dame playing running back, where my entire career before here played offensive line (I was a very fat child).",football,5
18,"This story is about my first time going golfing. During the summer of 2022, my roommate mentioned that the weather was really nice outside, and suggested we go golfing. I mentioned to him that I have never been golfing before and that caused him to insist that we go. When we got to the course, I came in with a confident attitude assuming I would have at least a moderate amount of success considering I grew up playing a number of sports and have decent hand eye coordination. We started by practice on the putting green a bit, and I was doing okay, so we moved on to the start of the course. As I set up for my first swing with the driver, my friend reminded me to start slow and just try to make contact with the ball, and that we can add in speed later. My only thought when I heard his advice was that he was underestimating my ability, so I proceeded to take a fast and hard swing at the ball. I missed the ball completely. I looked over and saw my friend laughing on the side. Over the course of the 9 holes that we were playing, the trend of me swinging and missing continued, but there was some slight improvement with the help of my friend. Overall, my first time playing golf taught me an important lesson about patience and persistance.",golf,3
19,"Notre Dame Women's Lacrosse was playing Florida in the Sweet Sixteen of the NCAA tournament. Disappointed after being overlooked to host the tournament, we flew to Gainesville to earn back the respect we deserved. We were on a mission to come home with two wins. The first win was easy, we emptied our bench and everyone celebrated getting to the bigger game that had been on all of our minds. Two days later, we would get the chance to make a statement and beat a top 8 ranked team - a status we so badly wanted. In the unbearable Florida heat in May, we dominated. Everyone was in their groove, implementing the game plan to a T. However, entering the last 8 minutes of the game, the Gators started to come back. We blew our five goal lead, eventually leaving the game tied with one minute remaining. They got the draw and looked like they would score easily again, just as they had done the last several plays. Our ride put an immense amount of pressure on, yard-saling their midfielder driving down the field. We gained possession and made the most of it. The winning goal came shortly after with 10 seconds remaining. Mission complete.",Lacrosse,5
20,"I have been swimming for my whole life, and I have had the same coach more most of my life. When I was younger, I would swim every summer on the Monmouth Beach Marlins. When you age up from 6 to 7, you have to start swimming the whole length of the pool. However, because I was faster than the other kids (and my sisters were also fast), I was aged up earlier than others not to my knowledge. The summer when I was 6 years old was not enjoyable due to the new challenge of having to swim the entire length of a 50 yard pool. I still did my best to power through however.

At one swim meet, having swam my hardest, I was finally able to relax and cheer on my teammates. Suddenly, my swim coach came over to me shouting, ""what are you doing sitting down, you're up next!"" I had one more event swimming against the age group above me. Flustered, nervous, and crying, my coach and dad dragged me to my lane and plopped me onto the starting block. The starter clicked the buzzer, and everyone dove for the race... except for me. I stood there crying and scared. Then comes my swim coach, casually strolling by, and as he passes me, shoves me into the pool. I then go on to cry and swim the entire length into the arms of my mom and the assistant coaches... in third place.

This story is about how I was initially unsure of my own abilities and scared, but I just needed someone to literally push me for me to realize my own potential.",Swimming,4
21,"A sports story that I will tell you about is about my first year in college. My freshman year of college was during the 2018-2019 school year. I attended Dartmouth College an Ivy League school in New Hampshire where I played Division I lacrosse there. Historically the team has been at the basement of the Ivy League for years in lacrosse and I committed there my freshman year of high school which was the 2014-2015 academic year, and at that time it was normal to commit that early. So, I knew that when I committed I would be seeing a lot of time there and starting/playing as soon as I stepped on campus which I did. I was the highest recruit that the school brought in for my position for the last ten years, and I was ready to make my mark on the team and in the classroom. I was in a wide awaking when I was a freshman at Dartmouth due to the academic demand of being at an Ivy League school and the fact that it was on a Trimester based system meant that the semester went by much faster. We would begin in the first week of September and finish the semester right before Thanksgiving. I really enjoyed being on the team and attending the school. However, it was hard on me because I would work so extremely hard at my craft of the sport day in and day out and come to the facility ready to work, and the fact that we finished the season 2-11 with no league wins was hard because I hate to lose, and everything I work towards is to have success, and when I do not have success, I have to pivot or changing what I am doing. I also try to stay the course and keep moving forward while at it. The one game I remember 4/13/19, and it was a game home vs Princeton. At that time Princeton had a top 5 player in the country in attackman Michael Sowers, so I had to guard him that game, and I knew that it was going to be a big test for me. It was very memorable for me because it was the last game that my grandma saw me play on earth before she passed away, and I will never forget it. She was very sick with cancer at the time and living at home with my parents and my dad would help put on all my games for her on the tv that we had downstairs so that she can watched me, and nothing made me more happy then doing that. We unfortunately lost the game, but it was the last time I heard from her and it has been over 4 years since then and I still have her voicemail she said to me saved on my phone, as that is the last time I heard her speak.

22,"January 2022. Raiders vs Chargers with a spot in the playoffs on the line. Being a 20 year old Raider fan at the time, I had only been old enough to remember us making the playoffs once, in 2016, when Derek Carr broke his leg on Christmas eve, ending a promising season. After a tumultuous season that saw our head coach get fired for some curiously timed leaking of emails, and our star WR kill a woman and her dog in a DUI car crash, the Raiders had somehow willed themselves back into the mix heading into the final week of the season. In a back and forth affair that ultimately came down to the end of OT, the Raiders ended up pulling it out after the Charger's head coach comically called a timeout, allowing us a couple extra plays to set up the GW winning FG. This was by far the best Raiders game I had ever watched and one of my fondest memories as a sports fan. ",Football,5
23,"When I was a kid, I was a quarterback in football and a shortstop in baseball. I wanted to be an NFL quarterback for the longest time, as I had a strong arm and could run really well. But, I wasn't the biggest kid on the team and wanted to grow taller like the quarterbacks in the NFL at the time who were 6 '2 and above. I read a book the was written by Michael Jordan that when he was a kid and wanted to grow taller, he would sprinkle salt in his shoes and pray every night that he would grow taller. Eventually, he grew to be 6 '6. In my case, I went on to play quarterback until high school until focusing on baseball, only growing to 5 '11. But that reliance and hope that I put in God shaped me throughout my sports career and life in general. ",Football,5

25,In my freshman year our team managed to remain undefeated going into our playoff weekend. However throughout the year I was dealing with issues regarding my knee cap dislocating while I was playing limiting my play and practice time. Heading into playoff we maintained our winning streak and made it to the championship game. I had been conservative with my play time but heading into the championship game I told my coach to just pretend I am not injured. As a defensive focused player I don't score often but late in the third quarter I took a shot from the outside and managed to put the ball top corner of the goal and score. We finished the game ahead by a couple goals and won the national championship. ,water polo,4

27,Growing up I was really clumsy and uncoordinated and my parents took me to many doctors to help me find my balance. They thought there was an issue with my eyesight or something really wrong with me. To the advice of one doctor they advised to put me in as many sports as possible and eventually I found my balance. Soccer was what stuck the most and after playing with my older sisters team my parents realized I was actually quite good. This eventually led to me playing soccer at Notre Dame and competing in the 2023 Women's World Cup. ,Soccer,5
28,"Growing up, I was almost the smallest kid in class. This affected me the most in sports, whether it was hockey, lacrosse, basketball, or soccer. One of my fondest memories in sports comes from a basketball game against St. Raymond when I was in the 8th grade. To give some context, I was probably 4 foot 9 or during the 8th grade. Before the game, our coach is giving us his usual pregame speech and announcing the starting lineup to the players. It was in this huddle when he said that I would be taking the opening tipoff. My teammates and I laughed after he mentioned this, because we happened to be facing off against the tallest player in the Catholic league. Their center was 6'7 in the eighth grade, which is unheard of. As my teammates and I walk onto the court, the fans and parents of the players in the gym laugh hysterically. I ultimately somehow won the tip off to deflected the ball to my teammate who went down and immediately ",Hockey ,4
29,"When I was in the fifth-grade I played for the A team on my middle school's basketball team. I'm not sure how I made it on the A team, considering I didn't have your typical basketball build – being a smooth 5'6 and 150 pounds. I was the man in the middle. Large and in charge. Running the show in my husky-sized shorts. And I embraced my role. At the end of the season we found ourselves playing our school's rival St. Joan of Arc in a nail bitter. We were down one with less than a minute to go, and they were in foul trouble. Somehow, as the clock ticked down, a loose rebound ended up in my hands. Match that with an aggressive St. Joan of Arc team, and I found myself standing at the charity stripe with the season on the line. Dribble. Dribble. Swish. First one went down. God is good. Tied ball game. Even the ref looked stunned before passing the ball back in my direction. I performed the same routine. Dribble. Dribble. And then I let that baby go. I watched in sheer hope as the ball traveled in what felt like slow motion towards the rim. The orange ball bounced back and forth, side to side inside the rim before finally going down. The entire gym, though only full of 40 some people, went berzerk. Somehow, the Crusaders did the unthinkable. Who knew. Me and my husky shorts.",basketball,5
