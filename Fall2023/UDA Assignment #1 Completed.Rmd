# Preliminaries
Load basic packages and adjust 
```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RedditExtractoR)
```


```{r echo = FALSE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CODE
# RUN THIS CELL TO UPDATE THE build_thread_df internal function so it returns extra data
# yes, we're hacking the package :}

# create revised function locally
build_thread_df <- function(json) {
  data.frame(
    date_utc = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "created_utc") |> 
      as.POSIXct(origin="1970-01-01") |>
      as.Date() |>
      format("%Y-%m-%d"),
    timestamp = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "created_utc"),
    title = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "title"),
    text = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "selftext"),
    subreddit = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "subreddit"),
    comments = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "num_comments"),
    score = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "score"),
    up_ratio = RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "upvote_ratio"),
    url = paste0(RedditExtractoR:::REDDIT_URL, RedditExtractoR:::extract_json_attribute(json, "permalink")),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
}

# replace the function in the package with this one
assignInNamespace(x = "build_thread_df", value = build_thread_df, ns = "RedditExtractoR")
```

## Sidetrack Challenge!
Read in the sample csv file, and check out the first row of data.  
There's a funky character in the title, and you're likely to have those showing up in your data too.  
See if you can work with the sample file to fix that character by replacing it with something correct.  
You can use a stringr function inside of a mutate to fix this for all rows in a column at the same time.
```{r}
#read in the sample csv file

#check out/fix the funky character - this is practice before your real data below
```


## Extraction code
Get your NEW data and assign it to an object
Use `find_thread_urls`
```{r}
df <- find_thread_urls(subreddit = "ultimate", sort_by = "new", period = "year")
```

## Fix it up
Add your new columns, fix that funky character in your title and text columns, and check that the final product looks ok  
```{r}
df_new <- df %>%
  mutate(sport = "ultimate",
         keyword = NA, 
         title = str_replace_all(title, pattern = "\031", replacement = "'"),
         text = str_replace_all(title, pattern = "\031", replacement = "'"))




```


## Write it out for submission
Call your file "reddit_posts.csv"
```{r}
write_csv(df_new, "C:/Users/alanski/Downloads/reddit_ultimate_classifiation.csv")
```

## Speculate a little
Why might the marketing/communications team get some value out of your (future) analysis of this data? In other words, what kind of insights might they be interested in and why? Related: do you think the coaching staff would find anything interesting here -- why or why not?  
*Note: you do NOT need to analyze any data to answer this question.  Scroll through the website a little bit to get a sense of what's there, and work with that general knowledge*   

Write a few sentences - no need for a big essay.  
  
### Your answer

## Consider a grouping for analysis
If you were going to analyze this data with some kind of grouping (not just each post separately), how would you want to group it? Why would that grouping be interesting?
