2023-07-19,1689744749,College Tryouts - what to expect/tips?,"I'm interested in joining my university's ultimate team in the fall. I've played with friends casually and unfortunately not in great shape. I'm also not super athletic but I've heard most ultimate players aren't so I'm not too sure how I compare against them (like vertical/speed). I can throw a decent backhand but my forehand is pretty nonexistent. 

My understanding is that they have an A and a B team. I'd much rather join the B team but I'm not sure if I'll even make that, given that they seem to cut and appear to be a top 40 D1 team. What should I expect at tryouts and do you guys have any tips for the next two months?  I do not have access to gym equipment.

2023-07-17,1689609501,Unpopular Opinion: Thoughts on the spirit scoring system,"Ultimate is becoming a mature sport - the rules of the game are no longer being massively redefined and the sport as a whole is gaining recognition on the international stage. Spirit is the one aspect that separates the sport from others, I'm not here to argue if we should have referees or observers, but I think the spirit scoring system has got to go:

""A detailed assigning of rating 0 to 4 in 5 categories (Rules knowledge and use; Fouls and body contact; Positive attitude and self-control; Fair-mindedness; Communication).""

My problems with this include:

1) It is highly subjective and unfair; for one, scoring preferences are different across different teams and countries, depending on how teams value a person/a certain incident will and can massively impact a score, which is different everywhere. This makes the scoring unreliable and inconsistent. With this, it is unlikely that all teams play all other teams, and therefore the 'Winner of Spirit' will just go to the team that has played against teams that score higher on average; those that weigh aspects higher than others. As well as this, Fouls, Rules and Communication usually require a call in the first place to give a stronger indication of higher scoring spirit scores, and therefore well-spirited games with fewer calls are weighted lower than well-spirited games with more calls as there are more opportunities to showcase these criteria. Further, it's impossible to take a proper opinion of the team's score because of the many-to-many relationships between the interactions of all of their players and all of your players, therefore, the score will never be correct. All of this makes spirit, essentially chance, where you can only hope to play teams that score highly, in a game that has a lot of calls to highlight your spirit, and hopefully, they can remember these events strongly.

2) It also encourages competition in what should just be common practice. For example, everyone should know all of the rules, and therefore there shouldn't be a reward for a team that knows the rules or applies the rules, because it's in the rules that you should know the rules. 

The way I see it, the only point of this scoring system in the first place, is to bring up any alarming problems around the use and application of the rules by a team, and surely this can be done with either formal complaint, or even just a pass/fail system, and not a pointless celebration of what is essentially knowing how to play the sport. It's unnecessary admin for everyone involved and delegitimises the sport.",ultimate,29,42,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1525w6p/unpopular_opinion_thoughts_on_the_spirit_scoring/,ultimate,NA

2023-07-14,1689362540,Neckies/Bandanas in the Summer for Playing Ultimate?,"
I was recently cleaning my room when I came across an old bandana from a high school summer camp, and I was wondering whether I might be able to make use of it while playing ultimate to help me keep cool and stave off sunburns?

I typically play with a VC neckie, which I find keeps me warm in the cooler months and helps me stand out in a crowd. In the summer, while I'd love to keep wearing it (I hate sunscreen), I find it gets too hot. I have seen some players wearing bandanas during tournaments in the summer. I think these look great, but I am wondering if there's also motivation to wear these for cooling/sun-protection in addition to style points?

More generally, what are your experiences playing ultimate in the summer with a neckie/bandana?",ultimate,3,10,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/14zpi53/neckiesbandanas_in_the_summer_for_playing_ultimate/,ultimate,NA

My teammates respect me for my skill as a cutter/deep threat and defender, but I feel like they don't really respect me for leadership abilities. In fact multiple times during practices my other captains and team veterans will make jokes that I am there to show up, score, and leave. I don't mind the jokes but I also don't like this narrative and I want to be seen as a captain who understands and can lead the field.

Anyone have any reviews on the new vapor edge pros, vapor edge speed, or the vapor edge 360? The Names are so similar so for clarity that's the low top, the mid cut, and the rereleased one

2023-07-11,1689050937,Rules question on blocking foul,"Is it legal to use your body to block another player's path?

Situation:
Offensive player A has the disc. Offensive player B is covered by defensive player b. B and b are behind A on the open side in the dump position. B cuts up the open side to go long. b follows. Offensive player C meanwhile is cutting in on the open side. C is open and has a clear path in. b, without looking at A or the disc, leaves B for a second to stand in the way of C. 

I would have assumed this would be a violation on b. The only rule I can find that talks about this scenario strictly refers to when the disc is in the air. 


17.I. 4.C. 
&gt; 1. When the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an 
opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc and any resulting non-incidental 
contact is a foul on the blocking player which is treated like a receiving foul (17.I.4.b). 
[[Solely. The intent of the player's movement can be partly motivated to prevent an 
opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc, so long as it is part of a general 
effort to make a play on the disc. Note, if a trailing player runs into a player in front of 
them, it is nearly always a foul on the trailing player.]]
2. A player may not take a position that is unavoidable by a moving opponent when 
time, distance, and line of sight are considered. [[If you are already in a position, you 
maintaining that position is not ""taking a position.""]] Non-incidental contact resulting 
from taking such a position is a foul on the blocking player.

So, is it legal to move in the way of a cut as long as you aren't creating a situation of unavoidable contact?",ultimate,8,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/14wh4w0/rules_question_on_blocking_foul/,ultimate,NA

2023-07-29,1690675197,"Wildwood ""Storm"" cancels the Party!?!","A staple of Wildwood every year: the Bier Garten. A place where friends and family alike can drink beer and have a good time. I personally was barely through my first beer when the announcement came through that the beach was being evacuated for a ""storm"". I (a naturally inquisitive and curious person) immediately doubted the realism of this ""storm"". The dark clouds were enough for most to go running, but I simply walked at a leisure pace knowing the truth. The ""storm"" was fake. 

The dark clouds brought a light wind and some sprinkles, and maybe a lightning strike or two, and then it was over as fast as it came. Nothing that couldn't be recreated with some cheap lights, fans, and a sprinkler head. 

The ""Wildwood police"" can deny it all they want, and the reason behind their actions is embarrassing, scandalous, and some might even say fraudulent. They're paid off by big beer, plain and simple. The beer truck was ""full"" when we showed up and then is shut down almost immediately. Due to increasing costs and inflation, big beer found it was easier to pay off the police than fund a real beer truck. 

Doubters will say that they saw lightning, were berated by strong winds, and pelted by raindrops the size of tic-tacs. They're just members of the brainwashed public or they're paid off by big beer too. You can't convince me otherwise. I will not be silenced, and big beer will never stop me from drinking.",ultimate,17,126,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15d6ubp/wildwood_storm_cancels_the_party/,ultimate,NA

For years I've said that, as adults, we have far too much autonomy for what goes into our bodies. Lucky for us, Mayor Pete Byron is here to make decisions for us.

I'm so pleased that our level-headed boys in blue will be there to enforce this draconian policy.

https://6abc.com/wildwood-beach-arrest-bodycam-assault-memorial-day-weekend/8410005/

I'm also glad that a part of my bid fee is going to pay for an officer to watch me sloppily lay out and throw stall 2 hammers. It's almost as if I'm paying a bid fee for them! Maybe next year the tournament can be 5 on 5, with each team having an assigned Behavior Compliance Officer to make sure no one is having too much fun.

Though we may have different opinions on this, it is important to know that personal attacks of any kind are never alright. The fact that Mayor Pete Byron is going on trial this August for Tax Evasion isn't important. Don't spread the word or make jokes about the poor, corrupt politicians who pushed for this ingenius policy.

2023-07-26,1690352496,Dangerous Play in Recreation League,"I agree with the intention behind dangerous play, but in terms of implementation I just went through a game where the rule was gratuitous abused by the other team. The opposing team threw multiple hospital passes (i.e. floaty poorly executed throws that allowed for multiple players to converge on the disk). About a third of these resulted in dangerous play calls. They basic intention seemed to be to use as it as a do-over in the event of poor decision making. 

I have no issue with dangerous play calls when the issue is just poor body awareness. For example, it's valid to call dangerous play when a defender bids into a cutter who has physically established themselves in that space. But adult recreation league is not club, and handlers make poor decisions all the time. If I a throw a hammer into a scrum in the end-zone,  I am accountable for creating a dangerous situation that the offense and defense has to react to. Rule 17.1.1 states that reckless disregard for the safety of other players is a foul, and as a thrower I'm creating a situation that is inherently dangerous for everyone involved regardless of my intention.   


I'm fine with the concept of dangerous play, but I'm not okay with other teams abusing it as a kind of rule exploit. Ugh. ",ultimate,38,40,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/159xjo6/dangerous_play_in_recreation_league/,ultimate,NA

2023-07-24,1690221406,Community leadership steering towards club vs league,"I recently moved to a new town and while there is a pretty good ultimate community here but there is some weirdness that I am finding. The organizers for ultimate here forego a summer league, there is a very active spring league but then the expectation is that you go and play club for the summer. There are two mixed club teams here, one pretty competitive drawing a lot of players from around the area (3hr radius) and it has fairly set roster/tournament travel expectation. The other team is a fledgling mix team that is having a hard time getting a roster of players with any base knowledge of ultimate. Tournament travel varies but since we are a fairly remote town, tournament travel expectations vary from 3hrs to the closest next city to 8-9hrs to more densely populated areas. 

I asked the organizers why they don't have a summer league and their response was that if there is a summer league then local players would opt to play league instead of club. My argument is if that is what the player ""demand"" is, then we should be ""supplying"" this instead of forcing players to get into club when they don't want that type of play/travel. Additionally I feel this is handicapping the growth of ultimate in our area. There were plenty of new players in spring league that would continue their growth via summer league but have no interest in joining a club team at this point. Are the organizers artificially hindering the area's ultimate growth? Has any other area seen a similar decision made in their community? 

I may be biased in this as I am a washed up club player that is just looking for low commitment league.",ultimate,13,18,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/158hw2a/community_leadership_steering_towards_club_vs/,ultimate,NA

2023-07-24,1690192225,WFDF Rule Question: not getting out of the endzone before making a pass,"The scenario is quite classic, so I'm a bit surprised I couldn't easily find prior discussion on this very topic. Offense player A catches the disc just before the end zone, but her momentum carries her into the end zone by a couple of inches (maybe ten centimeters). According to 14.3, she should of course take a step back to set her pivot on the goal line, but she doesn't realize that she's in the end zone, and instantly makes a pass to her teammate who was in the end zone and catches the disc. Neither of their defenders realized she was in the end zone either, and they kept reacting to the play as if player A was just outside of the end zone.   

&amp;#x200B;

A travel call was made after the last pass, on the grounds that player A didn't take the step back. My point however was that the travel didn't affect the play as all involved players played as normal, so a call shouldn't be made as per 1.3.10.

I have been mostly applying the 'Triphasic Training' principles as described in the book from Cal Dietz, which produced good results.

However for next season(s) I would like to take my physical preparation to the next level with a more personalized and sportspecific approach (off-season starting in November, in-season as from March with peaking in August to October next year for WUGC, national and European finals). As I believe I master the basics and have a decent foundation, I think I can handle a somewhat more advanced program.

I think I know a lot of the existing programs on the market (UAP, GPP, MPFPT, Breakside strength, Haddock...) but I would be happy to hear your thoughts and experiences with them if you are or have been in a similar situation.

Why buy? I'm a greedy sell out, but jokes. I want to have a way people can support me while getting something they can enjoy in return. The profits from sales will be going to funding better equipment to capture the sport. In addition sometime down the road funding trips to go to places that are still developing the sport of Ultimate and can't necessarily afford to hire me for an event. 

Use code NICEE on anything that's $69 for 15% off. I was going to just make the hoodies $60 but it's funnier this way.

After O gets broken twice or more, do they throw in some d-line players or put out a full D line?

What're your thoughts on having a strict O/D line for a whole season and in games, when to mix it up?

I've heard of just O and D lines but also something like O1, O2, D1, D2, flex (mixup) and kill (universe point lines with all top players) lines.

(Note I'm not saying that specific player did this on that play because I am not a mind reader.) 

Lamest spirit move I've seen lately is when a bad decision goes up and the receiver knows they're beat and instead of biding makes a half hearted attempt at plausible deniability by getting in the way of the bidding defender to create a foul where none would have existed with an effort play from both players.

This is particularly bad with players from sports where this is a legit strategy to use (basketball, mostly)

This is a super random topic in ultimate, but I am just curious about what y'all are doing to your nails before, after, and during the season. I LOVE to have my nails done, but it's just not worth it when I play ultimate to pay so much for them to break so quickly. It makes me feel so good and confident all the time, but ultimate wreaks havoc on them. So I now get them done like twice a year between seasons...

That being said, I have seen great players at college nationals with lash extensions and full acrylic or gel sets. I want to know what is your secret? How did you manage that grab flawlessly without breaking a nail? 

I find personally that having gel nails on before I play is really nice because even if the disc hits my gel nail, the gel is so hard that it protects my actual nail from breaking underneath it. But, I haven't found a method to make sure that the manicure doesn't break as well. For obvious reasons, I even keep my manicures very short if I know I'm going to play at all in the next few weeks. 

So is it possible to have it all? Is there a type of gel that I can use to mostly protect my manicure? Or have y'all also encountered the same issues and just given up on feeling like princess queens during the season?

2023-07-19,1689777576,Enforcing league rules,"Tldr: anyone got a good system for enforcing league rules?

So, I am involved in a city league that is trying to curtail unspirited and/or dangerous play. The current system is as follows: 

Any player in league can file a grievance. 
That player describes the incident(s), then the offending party is allowed to share a rebuttal, witnesses to the event are questioned, and the board then votes on whether to uphold the grievance. 

1st grievance: indefinite probation (verbal warning)

2nd grievance: 1 season suspension

3rd grievance: permanent suspension

If the board determines a grievance is severe enough, they can enforce suspension after any grievance.

In the years this has been in effect, there have been only a handful of grievances upheld and I'm not sure anyone has ever even gotten two. Usually they're for blatant disregard for the rules despite repeated discussions and/or getting in (verbal) altercations. There are also minor grievances that get dropped, typically where two parties seem to legitimately dispute a call and one decides the other must be cheating. Most recently, a player got one for playing too physically and essentially disregarding calls despite never reading the rules (guy who competes in a contact sport with refs and plays frisbee the same way).

I think our system is decent, but I was wondering what other leagues do and if anyone has something particularly effective. I really hate the idea of banning anyone but understand the balance with not having hotheads and unspirited players ruin everyone else's fun.

2023-08-13,1691913196,Stop saying Babbitt is the MVP,"Evan Lepler insists still that Babbitt is the front runner for MVP. The Empire had what will likely be one if he best games ever played& no Babbitt. I actually believe they played better because he was not there. Had he been out there, they would have played a different style that is not as good, fundamentally, as what they did.

Take an MVP from any sport, remove them from the team during what is a typically close rivalry& how many teams would play the best game they have ever played without the MVP? 

MVP has been selected from championship weekend teams as an unwritten rule. This leaves us with Kerr, Osgar, Swiatek and apparently Babbitt as the only real considerations. If you remove the first three for their respective teams, no way the team puts their best game together without them.

Kerr - Gls 39, Ast 53, Blk 8, Yds 5074, Cmp 282, Turns 11, +89

Osgar - Gls 17, Ast 68, Blk 2, Yds 5487, Cmp 344, Turns 12, +74

Swiatek- Gls 47, Ast 37, Blk 8, Yds 5792, Cmp 298, Turns 12, +75

Babbitt- Gls 50, Ast 2, Blk 15, Yds 2877, Cmp 183, Turns 4, +63

2023-08-12,1691846540,What is your least favorite ultimate frisbee rule?,"Which rule in ultimate do you think needs to be:
1. repealed?
2. Major overhaul?

For me its the pick rule that is my least favorite because it gets abused. One guy on our league calls pick all the time. Specifically in goal situations when he gets out ran by his opponent, he will call a pick when he was within 2 meters of an non catching opponent and more than 4 meters from his opponent he was defending. He didnt get touched either time. Both times my teammate was stationary.

My proposal for pick rule is contact has to be made by the opposing team and the defender has to be a  within 3 meters (10 ft) of the player he was covering.  No contact, but obstruced, no pick. Since ultimate is a non contact sports, i think making contact for a pick to be called is reasonable.

When i watch AUDL, i dont see picks getting called (maybe i dont see them called or AUDL has a more physical rule book)

TL:DR pick rule needs overhauling.

Edit: why ""pick"" bugs me so much is because 9/10 its called on goal plays,without contact. Why i argue for contact needing to happen, because without contact, its a grey area foul. And since the mid field is busy, obstruction can happen all the time. Making bogus non contact pick calls too common. But i also see why contact only rule would create <È style injuries, which we dont want to see in Ultimate. (Or any sport)

Edit 2: the guy (in our league) learned about the pick rule, ironically on a play where he got a goal but was called back because of a ""pick"" call. This time there was contact between his defender and this guy's teammate tad outside 7 meters. So maybe he calls pick all the time as revenge for that.",ultimate,88,10,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15p4i2u/what_is_your_least_favorite_ultimate_frisbee_rule/,ultimate,NA

2023-08-12,1691815481,Cut-From-Front Vert,"I was wondering why cut-from-front vert is not nearly as popular as cut-from-back vert outside of end zone offense. 

On paper, it seems to me like you're trading deep threat (from the back, you can threaten under and deep) for more break threat (a break to front of stack is easier/develops faster). Depending on your personnel, that sounds like it could be worth it sometimes and warrants more use than it gets.

I've also heard that the back should cut because they can see all the other cuts, but I feel like that's a non-factor if you're on the same page about initiating from the front.

There's probably something I'm missing since I haven't played high-level club; what's wrong with cut-from-front vert?",ultimate,12,13,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15ov0ng/cutfromfront_vert/,ultimate,NA

For example

- F45 (cardio vs muscle endurance days)
- Barry's 
- BFT 
- Etc

2023-08-11,1691780260,Rules Quiz!,"I'm specifically curious about USAU ruling on this scenario, though happy to hear the WFDF ruling as well. 

Hanna is on D and is picked. Meanwhile, the disc is thrown by the thrower (1) to her offender (2) and then immediately thrown to another offensive player (3). Hanna calls a pick as soon as she realizes, though the disc has already moved on to the third person. That third person then throws another short, quick pass which gets D'd by a big layout from Rex. So that was two completed passes and then a turnover. It all happens very quickly. Some people are yelling pick, but no one involved in the throwing noticed yet. Hanna's pick call was somewhere during the catch/throw between O players 2 and 3, but she called the pick in response to the pass between 1 and 2. 

Hopefully that's clear-ish! 

So, what is the outcome in USAU? 

A) It is a turnover. 

B) It is not a turnover. Disc returns to (1).

C) It is not a turnover. Disc returns to (2). 

D) It is not a turnover. Disc returns to (3).

And a follow-up question if it is not ruled a turnover: Can the pick call be retracted, resulting in a turnover?",ultimate,32,2,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15ohd5q/rules_quiz/,ultimate,NA

2023-08-11,1691771535,The only good thing about no refs is it's cheaper,"Unpopular Opinion : The ultimate Frisbee community has this idea that somehow a self - refereed sport is better then having refs. 

But really we all just want to save money and we're too cheap for refs.  Instead of admitting we don't want to pay for refs. We say, no refs isn't a bug of our sport it's a feature! 

Why would I want an unbiased 3rd party to officiate my game when we could save money and get emotionally driven calls that always come up the tighter the game is?

Instead of quick resolution and the ability to move on what if we paused the game for two minutes while two dudes waste time  acting out what happened.

Instead of being mad at our refs for bad calls, what if instead we had to self officiate and be mad at our friends for being inperfect human beings who can't possibly be expected to be unbiased and rational in real time?

Instead of being like most adult sports , we don't want to pay the price of refs and we act like there's no tradeoffs, only a beautiful paradise free from evil referees and their sinful nature.",ultimate,134,138,0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15odl0j/the_only_good_thing_about_no_refs_is_its_cheaper/,ultimate,NA

2023-08-11,1691766525,Rules question,"A handler is throwing a disc to a cutter upfield. The cutter receives contact from the person guarding them and calls a foul. They stop playing when the foul is called and the disc is not caught. The defender did not contest the foul but expressed that the disc wasn't catchable because it was thrown too far/the receiver was too slow. However because they did not contest the foul the disc went to the intended receiver on stall 0. 

What should have happened? 

If there is a foul on an intended target but the disc is uncatchable is it not a foul because it didn't affect the outcome of the play? 

Should it always go back to the thrower and in an uncontested scenario they get stall 0 and contested they stay on the stall they were at?

When my team is on offense:

HOLD - Offense receives and scores. Subcategory: CLEAN HOLD, a hold with no turns

BROKEN - Offense receives and defense forces a turn and scores

When my team is on defense:

BREAK - Opposing team receives, we force a turn and score 

?????? - Opposing team receives and scores

&amp;#x200B;

What goes in the ?????

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously it is a ""hold,"" but I feel like we use different words for our team and the opposing team. If my team turns and gets scored on, we got broken. If we force the turn and score, we got a break. If we score on O, it is a hold. If the opponent scores on O, they... held? Holded? Beholden? Holed?

Recently my friend got really into ultimate. He complains about not having a disc, so I thought I'd get him one for his birthday. After some research I figured the Ultrastar is the go-to option, as well as not being that expensive. I was intrigued seeing the recycled version of the disc, but it left me wondering. Surely the recycled plastic's feel isn't identical? Is there a significant difference? If so, how bad is it? Bear in mind, I have very little idea about discs, so please try not to use any advanced terms.

2023-08-08,1691516981,"If rime expired before the greatest, should this count?","https://youtube.com/shorts/B0IHgdCcEkc

Someone on Facebook commented that if time expired before the greatest then the goal shouldn't count. I've read through the AUDL rules and I can't come to a conclusion either way.

Rules I'm trying to reconcile:

5.2.5: if the clock shows 00:00.0 and the disc is in the air, the play should continue until the result of the throw is determined. No subsequent throw shall be permitted, regardless of the existence of a pivot foot. The period or game will end when the disc touches the ground or is caught.

10.2.2: A player may throw the disc without stopping and establishing a pivot if:
The player does not speed up or change direction after catching the disc, and The player throws the disc before they take a third step after catching the disc.

10.2.4: A player may tip, brush, or MAC any throw, including their own, to another player.

12.1.1 A goal is scored when an inbounds player catches the disc in the end zone they are attacking and maintains possession of the disc throughout ground contact.

17, Completion: When a player gains possession of a disc within the field of play and prior to ground contact.

17, MAC: Mid Attitude Change (brushing or tapping the disc to change its direction without catching it).

17, Possession: When a player has control of a non-rotating disc.

17, Thrower: An offensive player with the disc and a pivot.

My initial though is that it should not count, but my hangup is on whether or not the definition of a completion is the same as a catch. I realize that may be semantics, but a catch could insinuate through ground contact, since technically you can have a completion and land out of bounds for a turnover by this definition.

**Field setup:**   
The 2-point activation box is either placed in the back corners of each end zone, or it can be a single activation box, placed in the back center of the endzone. Box dimensions TBD (corner boxes: 3ydx3yd or single center box: 3ydx5yd)  


**Play:**   
1) After the pull, during the ensuing play, the 2-pt bonus is activated when an offensive player catches the disc in the 2pt box. (Must have at least a foot in the box). After activation, if the offensive team successfully moves the disc the length of the field for a score, the goal is worth 2 points.   
2) Conversely, if the Defensive team scores a Callahan during bonus play, the score is worth 2 points. 

3) The 2-point bonus expires on a turn.   
During the pull, offenses could create pull-plays that purposefully go backward to activate the two-point bonus option.

The 2-pt bonus is only available at the start of each point.

2023-08-02,1691002785,How should I prepare to make a strong club team next season?,"I've never played club before, but I'm hoping to improve enough over the next ~9 months to be able to next season. I want to put in a lot of work and get onto the highest-level team I possibly can.

I'm a 5'10"" 27 year old guy who's been playing for ~8 years, but I've only been actually trying to improve on and off for the last ~4. In league, I can be a lower player on a high division team, or I can be a play driver on an intermediate team.

I'm fairly athletic, with good fast twitch genetics -- sprinting, accelerating hard, and catching are natural advantages, but my cardio, touch, and decision-making need a lot of work. Obviously I'll need to improve literally everything.

What kind of training do you think can help me improve as much as possible in this time frame? I'm thinking I should be:

- doing plyos, hill sprints, and intervals, as well as learning proper layout form, to lean into my natural advantages and become a player who can score deep even at a high level of play
- throwing hundreds or thousands of throws a week, ironing out kinks in my mechanics and developing muscle memory and touch for core throws, and continuing to develop a wide variety of niche throws like lefty backhand, scoobers, push passes, etc
- critically analysing video (e.g. on Ultiworld) and taking notes
- playing a lot every week with players better than me, focusing on incorporating lessons from above analysis

Would your list be different? What would you recommend for someone in my position?",ultimate,30,42,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15ghie1/how_should_i_prepare_to_make_a_strong_club_team/,ultimate,NA

I feel it could even contend with the big sports which makes me wonder where it actually ranks.

 * Football - Once people are out of highschool, it's almost unheard of for anyone to actually *play* football.  I hardly count throwing a football around and running some plays with a few friends but others could argue this counts.

 * Baseball - Same as football but adult leagues often exist.  I've never heard of making informal pickup games though.

 * Hockey - The high cost of entry and requirement for a rink makes this seem like an easy one to beat out.

Some that I think have it beat are basketball, soccer, maybe volleyball.",ultimate,55,32,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15ggxr1/does_anyone_have_an_accurate_source_for_where/,ultimate,NA

2023-08-24,1692894492,Introducing UltiStats.app - a new platform to track stats and get insights on your team's performance!,"[https://youtu.be/8JE0rS\_q2aA](https://youtu.be/8JE0rS_q2aA)

As I've promised a few times here, I've been working on a webapp to help teams track their stats, but I also wanted to make something that would be more than just something to track goals, assists, and D's. 

After about seven months of work, I am proud (and nervous as hell) to present [UltiStats.app](https://www.ultistats.app)! 

Using this app, you can create a team, set your roster, create events (with an event roster and games), and track every pass. Afterwards, you can see team leaders in goals, assists, and blocks, as expected, but you will also get stats including yards, +/-, and visual reports. You can see exactly where your turnovers occurred, who is throwing to who, and the types of passes each player is attempting (and where they are turnover-prone). 

Now, this sort of a test-run - I have developed this completely on my own and from scratch, and I will also admit that I am not a statistician (and I'm barely a programmer). I'm sure people will find bugs, and I'm also sure that people will have suggestions on other stats or reports to include. I am open to any and all feedback on that front. There is a [contact form](https://www.ultistats.app/contact) available once you sign up for an account.

I plan on always keeping a free version of this app available. That being said, I did put some features behind a paywall, those being the ability to make preset lines for a tournament, which makes it a lot easier to set your lineup on each point, and some of the reporting features (advanced stats beyond goals/assists/D's/touches, and graphical reports). Right now, if you sign up for an account and subscribe, there is a free trial for the rest of 2023. You can cancel your membership anytime before 12/31/2023 and never get charged. All payments are handled by Stripe, so it is secure and I never see any of your credit card information.

Good luck, and thanks!",ultimate,12,73,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/1606q7g/introducing_ultistatsapp_a_new_platform_to_track/,ultimate,NA

&gt;- Personnel Ratio Violation: Violations of the prescribed personnel ratio will be handled the same as an offsides/false start violation (9.B.4.d) with the exception that the team calling the violation may choose to have a repull or to put the disc in play per 9.B.4.d.

It **now** reads:

&gt;4\. For all Mixed games 

&gt;1. Personnel Ratio Violation: Violations of the prescribed personnel ratio and how they are handled are described in 2022-2023 Official Rules of Ultimate (9.B.3.a).

&gt;2. Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the majority pull rule will be handled the same as an offsides violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling offsides, the offense should call majority pull violation. Like with offsides violations, after the first majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as described in 9.B.4.d.2. Majority pull rule violations accumulate separately from offsides/false start violations. In games with observers, either the observer or a player on the field may call the violation.

2023-08-16,1692208486,"Obstructed by my teammate playing help defense, what happens?","USAU Rulset.  Here's the scenario, Offensive player runs straight deep, and I'm chasing about 6 feet behind and 1 foot to their right. An OI flick goes up along the right sideline. As I'm closing the gap, my teammate comes in on a diagonal line from the left and runs directly between me and the offense. My teammate decides they can't make the play and starts to slow down, obstructing me and forcing me to run around them. At this point, my teammate is about 3 feet behind the offense, I am about 4 feet behind the offense and the disc is slowing down. I call pick.  


I felt I would have had a direct line to the disc since I was on their right side where the disc was. I was also actively making up ground on the offense. So, I felt I could have at least contested if not blocked the catch. But, when I'm reading the rules on picks, it states:  


17.J.1 - A pick occurs whenever an offensive player moves in a manner that causes a defensive player guarding ([3.E](https://usaultimate.org/rules/#3.E)) an offensive player to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the obstructing player.

&amp;#x200B;

The rule uses the words ""whenever an offensive player moves in a manner..."" and in this case, it was the defense (my teammate) that moved in a manner that caused the obstruction.

2023-08-15,1692124569,Yet another cleats post (Freeze V2s vs V4s),"Hey y'all,
My friend and I have been trying the new balance freezes recently, and I'm a bit stuck on which to get. I've only actually tried on the V2s and V4s, both mid-cuts and not wide. When trying them, I felt like the V2s fit better and gave me more cutting traction, but I have a couple contentions with commiting to them. 
First, I have wide feet and the V2s that are still sold are not available as wides (I know NB already runs wide, but I'd like it more so). Second, from what I've read, the V4s should have better spikes with more traction which kinda makes me feel like I gaslit myself into thinking the V2s had more since my friend had already told me he preferred the V2s. 

In other words, does anyone else also prefer the V2s in traction or comfort or have any advice on what to choose? If I don't get the V2s, I'd probably be looking at the wide, low-cut V4s unless you guys advise something else. I'm mainly looking for a good cleat that will last me a long time and give me a good balance of comfort for tournaments and traction for cuts.

I've seen rave reviews on here for the NB freeze cleats so thought I'd give them a try.

They seemed to significantly exacerbate an ankle underpronation tendency I have to the point of triggering noticeable knee instability.  Reverting back to an old pair of Nikes seemed to resolve this.

With the freeze I can see just standing how bad I'm rolling over to the outside of my foot.  Anyone else have a similar experience or ideas on what it is about that cleat design would explain that?

I was wondering if there were any other ideas on how to beat it, specifically on the rotation back to defence. We seemed to lose track of our mark when coming back to defence ourselves. ",ultimate,40,22,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15qzyvo/how_to_beat_zone_defence/,ultimate,NA
2023-08-14,1692030488,How to get your backhands to slow down?,"It seems to me that the best backhand (and flick, for this matter) hucks are the ones that get to the target zone fast, and then hover/slowly descend. 

This gives the biggest window for the receiver to change their angles as necessary and win a foot race to run ""into"" the slowly-descending disc.

I'm having a hard time finding this perfect zone. 

My hucks are either thrown too strong -- where they never ""slow down"" and typically sail out the back unless my receiver makes a ridiculously athletic play.

Or my hucks have too much loft, which lets not only my intended receiver, but their defender, and possibly other defenders catch up and turning it into a hospital pass jump ball.

What are tips that lend themselves to finding consistency in the perfect backhand huck which gives the biggest window for the receiver but not soo big as to allow defense to catch up.",ultimate,18,43,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/15qzgtu/how_to_get_your_backhands_to_slow_down/,ultimate,NA

The issue I have is my brain is telling me the high level I played at but my fitness is well and truly gone.

Worse is I feel like a beginner again and noticed that on my backhand 3 things :  


1. I'm taking my eyes off my receiver when I throw a backhand with the result being then throwing the disc really far to  the right (from my perspective). So it will really hook to the receiver's left. So this is as a right handed person.
2. I'm getting a lot of height on the disc. I feel like as I give my final flick to release that the disc is flying up way higher.
3. I'm just not getting that flick and stabilisation in the air

###Club Sectionals

---

Sectionals are the first step of the postseason for most teams in the USA Ultimate club series. Outside of a handful of elite teams who participated in enough qualifying regular season events to skip Sectionals, every other team wishing to progress in the postseason must participate at Sectionals. It is generally a tuneup tournament for most competitive teams, although there can be some spicy results depending on the section.

2023-09-06,1694023395,Rules Question: Inaudible stalls,"This happened at a local league game recently:

I was stalling the thrower, bit on a fake so I tried to layout to block the throw, was on the ground (but still within 10 feet), continued to stall from there, and by the time I stood back up, I was saying ""Stalling 9, Stalling 10, Stall!"". The thrower says they couldn't hear me after stall 6 (when I went to the ground) and thought I stopped stalling. I never stopped stalling out loud the whole time, but I can see how he might not have heard me.

What is the rule on this? Is my stall call valid? Should he have stopped play because he couldn't hear me? Is it considered a fast count? I checked the USAU Rules on ""The Marker"" and it just says the Marker must audibly stall, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if the thrower can't hear.",ultimate,52,30,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/16br75f/rules_question_inaudible_stalls/,ultimate,NA

This happened just before 1h11m~ in this video. The red player (offense) bumps the white player (defense) just before the white player jumps, likely preventing his attempt at the disc from being successful.

White called a foul on the field, then retracted the call.

I coach ultimate in Seattle. Tragically (for me), one of the most exciting and best young players I've seen in a long time is moving this fall to Houston and will be a freshman at Clements HS - a school with no ultimate team. Could someone who's familiar with Houston youth ultimate help me understand the lay of the land so I can get this kid connected with a program in the area? I also reached out to HUC (houston ultimate community) and looked at their map of schools that had ""expressed interest"" in having a team but I'm not sure how great of a lead the latter is.

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone connect me to the YCC coaches in Texas to get this kid on their radar? Are free agents for HS teams a pretty common situation? It looks like the HS season happens in the spring but that's about all I've figured out so far. Anything and everything helps!

2023-09-01,1693558605,"How to watch ultimate on ESPN+, ESPNU, etc  including new international options!","###Watch ultimate on ESPN channels: A guide

---

For a few tournaments a year, ultimate is broadcast on an ESPN channel such as ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN+, etc. There are usually a number of folks with questions on how to watch ultimate on these platforms, so I've compiled a few of the most common questions and put them below for easy reference.

---

***Definitions***

---

- ESPN2 and ESPNU are traditional television channels. These can be watched on television or online.
- ESPN3 is an online-only platform that typically requires a cable TV package to access (or utilize a free workaround). Watch games through your computer, phone, or devices such as Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.
- ESPN+ is an online-only platform that requires a standalone monthly subscription to access (or it can be bundled with other TV services like Disney+ and Hulu). ESPN+ does not include access to ESPN2, ESPNU, or ESPN3.

---

***When can ultimate be found on ESPN channels?***

---

The following tournaments usually broadcast games on an ESPN channel:

- D-I Championships (College)
- US Open (Club)
- Pro Championships (Club)
- National Championships (Club)

Typically, pool play games and early bracket play will be broadcasted by USA Ultimate or a third party such as [Ultiworld](https://ultiworld.com/live), while ESPN covers semifinals and finals.

---

***How can I watch ultimate on ESPN2 or ESPNU?***

---

ESPN2 and ESPNU games are easy to access since they are dedicated TV channels. Here are several methods:

- Just turn on your TV and cycle through. Your cable package may have it, even if you didn't realize.
- Go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) on your computer or the Watch section of the ESPN app and login with your cable TV credentials. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)
- Go to a bar or restaurant and ask a bartender/server to change the channel. Be patient and friendly.
- Google ""free ESPN2"" or ""free ESPNU stream"" or something similar. Look for sketchy-looking URLs and domain names. I'm serious - there are many sites streaming these channels for free, and they ALL have dodgy URL names. Just close any pop-ups that appear. A couple sites I recommend are tv247us[dot]com/watch/espn-u/ and bigbro8fan[dot]weebly[dot]com.

---

***How can I watch ultimate on ESPN+?***

---

Unlike the other ESPN platforms, there are essentially no free workarounds to watching ultimate on ESPN+. On the bright side, it's very easy to set up and watch:

1. Go to [Plus.ESPN.com](https://plus.espn.com/) and follow the steps. The cost is $10/month for the standard bundle or $13/month for a bundle including Disney+ and Hulu. There are no free trials.
2. Once subscribed, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with your credentials. You can also watch ESPN+ on [a variety of devices and apps](https://help.espnplus.com/espnplus_hc?id=espnplus_article_content&amp;article=espn-plus-supported-devices) including the ESPN app on your phone.
3. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)

**Cost-Saving Methods**

- Annual plans include two months free.
- [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/) offers cash back on monthly and annual plans.
- Verizon customers with a 5G Get More or 5G Play More plan may qualify for [free access.](https://www.verizon.com/support/disney-bundle-faqs/#eligible)

---

***How can I watch ultimate games on ESPN3?***

---

**If you have a cable package with ESPN3 access, it's easy:**

- Go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) on your computer or the Watch section of the ESPN app and login with your cable TV credentials. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)

**If you don't have a cable package with ESPN3 access, there are several workarounds:**

1. First, if you have ANY cable package, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login, just in case. Sometimes ESPN3 is complimentary, or you have an ESPN package you don't know about.
2. If you have access to a college campus or military base, simply connect to its wifi and visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) above. ESPN3 is free and included for most colleges and military bases in the US.

    Note: You can often access college campus wifi even if you're not a student. Connect to the Guest wifi or ask at the local visitor center. For military base wifi, just hop the fence or charge the gate. Free access for a year or more.
3. Try a free trial of a service that includes ESPN3 access, such as [Fubo](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome), [Hulu TV](https://www.hulu.com/live-tv), or [Youtube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/). Some of these services may let you register for a new free trial on the same account/card if enough time has passed. After subscribing, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with your account credentials, or follow the instructions of the respective TV service.
4. If nothing else, try a bootleg stream. [RareTode](https://www.twitch.tv/raretode) (/u/saswink) often streams games. Other users are [EatPrayFartSomeMore](https://www.twitch.tv/eatprayfartsomemore) (/u/EatPrayFart) and [Sascha](https://www.youtube.com/user/bandninja27) (/u/ultimatesascha). These links have worked in the past: TV247US[dot]com/espn-3,  tv247[dot]us/espn-3/, MyGoodStream[dot]pw/espn. Finally, try [this suggestion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/dncmvh/europeans_usa_nationals_is_available_on_espn/f59rwrp/?context=3)

***I'm an international viewer. How can I watch?***

---

For years watching ultimate on ESPN channels has been difficult if not impossible for international viewers. In 2023 USAU introduced a solution, offering a paid package covering the ESPN games for individuals outside the United States. The package varies per event but is usually $10-12. [Click here to buy it.](https://usaultimate.vhx.tv/)

Note: The site apparently has a geofence that prevents users in the United States from watching, but I'm curious how rigid that is, or if it could be exploited with a VPN like [Hola](https://hola.org/). If anyone tests it, let me know.

**Other Options for International Viewers:**

If USAU is not offering a paid package for international viewers, you may still have some options to watch ESPN games. First, try the steps listed above for the respective ESPN channel. You never know, it just might work. If it fails, some common troubleshooting methods are below:

- If you are not allowed to register for a service due to your location, try using a VPN such as [Hola](https://hola.org/) (free) or Express VPN (paid). You can also try [this non-VPN method.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/cllldg/any_kind_american_soul_streaming_the_us_open_on/evxu303/)
- If you are not allowed to register for a service due to not having a US credit card, try using Paypal or buy a Google Play gift card and use that.

You can also try a free trial of [ESPN Player.](https://www.espnplayer.com/) This is an official service provided by ESPN to viewers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/qe8qzd/psa_how_to_watch_the_espn3_streams_from_europe/) for more details. Note that ultimate is [not always offered](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/qerrzc/reply_by_espn_support_regarding_international/) on ESPN Player.

---

***The event is over. Can I still watch the ESPN games?***

---

Probably, and you might have to wait.

- If you have ESPN access, go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with whatever method you have or open the ESPN app on your phone. Go to [Schedule &amp; Replays](https://www.espn.com/watch/schedule), click [Replay](https://www.espn.com/watch/schedule/_/type/replay), then use the filters to find the games. However, some games may not be viewable, even if they have direct links to the games. [See this thread for details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/rq0fy8/is_it_true_that_it_is_impossible_to_rewatch_the/)
- If you don't have ESPN access, or the games aren't listed or viewable online, try visiting USAU's [Watch page](https://usaultimate.org/watch/playlist/full-games/) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/usaultimate) account.

###Pro Championships

*September 2-5 in partly cloudy Milwaukee, WI*

---

The Pro Championships are the final tournament of the club regular season. Not to be confused with professional ultimate, the ""Pro"" in Pro Championships refers to the Pro Flight of the [Triple Crown Tour](https://usaultimate.org/club/) (aka the top eight teams at Nationals last season). There are also a few teams from Elite flight to fill vacancies and add more competition.

The Pro Championships feature a bevy of high-level competition (every single team is ranked in the [Ultiworld Top 25](https://ultiworld.com/club-rankings/)) and are the only sanctioned club tournament occurring this weekend. The regular season technically concluded last weekend, but Pro Championships have a special designation to still count in the rankings.

At the end of the night, During the last game to 7, as I was playing on the light team, I noticed that one of the  players on the dark team was wearing my dark shirt.  I don't think he grabbed it by accident because it's an unusual golf shirt with a collar, with a logo of a college many states away.  I've never met this guy before this game and he absolutely did not ask if he could borrow my shirt.  I shrugged it off and when the game was over.  I went to the sideline and he hadn't put my shirt back.  So I walked over and he wa  sitting down and had changed into his own shirt.  So I grabbed my shirt and he looked up and said ""do you want me to wash it?""  I said no, he said thanks and I went home.  
Ok not the biggest of deals, but in my 22 years of playing I've loaned shirts to lots of people, but never once has anyone grabbed  and worn a shirt of mind without asking.

We have incredible live music playing from the moment you arrive until the outdoor stage shut down at 11 pm - but that's when things really get going! We have an amazing band playing late night in the beautiful old barn, a massive bonfire, huge silent disco, lawn games - and the shenanigans in the beer tent are legendary...

Clambake is a fundraiser for Maine Special Olympics, and to celebrate the 35th we'll raise $35,000 this year, adding to the over $600,000 we've raised since 1989!

We've been running operations for the past couple months, but are now ready to re-launch to the world!!

**Our Top Priorities:**

\#1. Catch up any outstanding orders to make sure all past customers prior to the acquisition are served at the highest level. 

\#2. Restructure production to bring turnaround times to an average of 4 weeks, even for full subs.

\#3. Create the best line of Ultimate apparel in the industry. We've created a top tier line we believe is similar but superior to the popular Patagonia Ultimate gear.

To celebrate our re-launch, all Five and Vii team and league orders will be **25% off through September 30, 2023!** In addition, to celebrate Five and Vii carrying Discraft discs again, Discraft will be graciously providing **25 Free Custom Ultra-Stars** for the first 12 teams who order in the next 2 weeks.

This is a one time discount to bring teams back and try our new fabric, and we don't plan on discounting in the future.

Five Ultimate and Vii Apparel (formerly Savage Ultimate) were pioneers in the Ultimate industry. At Disc Store, we have great admiration and respect for what the Five Titcomb siblings- Vehro, Xtehn, Qxhna, Rohre, and Zahlen, and what Todd Curran, founder of Savage Ultimate have created. 

We are extremely excited to carry on the rich tradition created by our predecessors, bringing back some of the best apparel from the past and creating the best Ultimate jersey of the future. 

The Disc Store team is now fully running the Five and Vii brands which means you can also expect the highest level of friendly customer service. We believe in putting customers first and always going the extra mile for you.

We'd love to help with your next team or league order! Please reach out to [team@fiveultimate.com](mailto:team@fiveultimate.com) or [sales@viiapparel.co](mailto:sales@viiapparel.co) to give us a try!

2023-08-30,1693437427,To each of us - my spirit rant,"tldr;  
Stop making the outcome of the game more important than how its played  
Losing your cool, on or off the field, is not cool  
Don't make it the other team's responsibility to police your team, you do it

We've got some big problems with the competitive teams and tournaments in this sport. Some would say it comes down to having refs or not, or observers or not but I think it comes down to practicing what we preach. Much easier said than done.

Right now we are a bunch of hypocrites. We pretend to say the values we play by are important but then match after match we demonstrate the opposite. Sure there's the occasional examples of great spirit but they are overshadowed by game after game of egregiously biased calls.

It is clear that outcome is far more important to us than how the game is played. You can hardly go to a competitive game from high school through club divisions without seeing this on display. It seems that as the stakes rise that so do the number of calls made on the field, and with that the number of contested calls as well.

We let our biased teammates take over the game, not with their skill but with their horrible calls, crappy perspectives, and toxic attitudes. We justify it by saying it's their perspective and they have the right to argue it. We justify it because it helps our team. We allow it to happen by keeping silent even though we know the call was bad and that player has a history of doing this. No one wants to go watch a game of hot-headed players arguing and abusing the self-officiating system that we have, but that's exactly where we are. 

As captains we let these toxic players ruin the game and the sport because we have the hope that their call will help us win or that it will at least offset the bad calls from the other team. We say we can't act that way but then we don't do anything to stop that player from dictating the tone of the game with their bad calls and attitudes.

As coaches we let our players do all the talking and make decisions because we've been trained not to interfere. We may talk about spirit every now and then and hope that a player or two presents well, but we let those ultra-competitive players run amuck and tell ourselves it's not our place step in.

We believe it's the other team's job to police us. We put the responsibility on them to tell us about our bad calls, our bad attitudes, our abuse of the system, our fighting fire with fire, our escalation of tension. We make them deal with our toxic players that we can't deal with ourselves.

**STOP IT!**

This won't get better until you and I, as players and coaches, take responsibility to play fair, even when the other team doesn't. This won't get better until we are willing to stop letting our desire to win rule over our desire to play fair. We must be willing to sacrifice for it.

This won't get better until we stop calling that little brush by the other player, stop running into players on purpose to call a pick, stop calling contact on the mark because of our wild throw and follow through, stop calling in and out calls that we had no perspective or horrible perspective on, stop calling fouls when we back up into other players, stop calling strips when we never actually caught the disc, stop calling fouls on things we know didn't affect us.

This won't get better until captains call out our own players and stop worrying about the other team. This won't get better until we overturn our own team's obvious bad calls, until we bench our players that abuse the system, until we make our own team have consequences.

We keep believing the little lies that no one will like this game unless we have angry players risking each other's life to try and win. We keep believing that the other sports are more successful because of their poor displays of spirt, not in spite of it.

We don't need that in order to be successful. Professional athletes not being able to control their anger at home, going off the rails in their private lives... these are not signs of success and they're not the reasons why those leagues became successful in the first place. These are signs that we've lost our value system and we're seeing the consequences.

**How we play the game is more important than the outcome**, even in the AUDL or club championship finals. We pretend that spirit of the game makes us different but in reality it's just lip service.

New, young and developing players watch you and you determine how they will behave. You can lie to yourself and say your actions don't influence others, but that's not true. Think about how other players' actions influence you. Do you escalate poor behavior and attitudes? Do you make bad calls to make up for theirs? Do you contest calls because the outcome of the call would hurt your team? Do you fight fire with fire?

We've all been in games like this. What are we doing to be the change? It's not going to work if we keep deflecting the responsibility to the other team, we need to be responsible for our team, even when or especially when the other team isn't.

Be the difference. Hold yourself accountable, hold your teammates accountable, hold your team accountable. Don't police the other team, police yourself.

I defy you to find specific information about where this event is taking place by looking at the USAU website. First, it's not even on the home page. Gotta click on CLUB and then SCHEDULE, where you get a listing that says the tournament is in ""Milwaukee.""

It's not an enormous town, but Milwaukee is big enough to make specifics pretty important here. Clicking ""LINK"" next to each division brings you to the Score Reporter page. No details here! Click at the top to go to the tournament page and then find the ""Travel, Directions &amp; Accomodations"" link. Click that to see that the actual tournament page is ""[www.milwaukeeultimate.com](https://www.milwaukeeultimate.com),"" but it's not linked. Cool... embedded linking is only a 30-year-old technology. And by the way, that link isn't really helpful. Gotta look at the calendar on that page to see, in small type, that the event is at Uihlein Soccer Park, which I then will look up directions for.

To sum up, this is one of just three events in USAU's Triple Crown and I'm 5-6 clicks deep before I even know the name of the venue.

Just getting into competitive ultimate and I can't for the life of me figure out how the grandmasters tournament schedule works.

It looks like some of the regionals happened and some didn't happen?  My assumption was that the top X teams from each regional go to nationals, but there are 8 regions and it looks like there were 16 teams at nationals, but it wasn't limited to the top 2 per region - there were 4 teams from south central (at least) in nationals.

Sorry maybe it's common knowledge what happened but I can't find any info on the site!

Also for world competition, is there a ""team usa"" for grandmasters?  Or is it like the top 2 teams at nationals go?  Or is it just whoever signs up?

Just wanted to discuss with some people what you think we might find? (For background, I stopped playing club around a decade ago but still play pickup goalty and watch some club games.) I feel like there's so much that can be used to analyze plays, sections of the field where your team is scoring more/other teams are scoring against a specific team's defense, etc.

And I've never done python but did a lot of coding work, so I'm pretty sure I can learn. How difficult is this sort of analysis to conduct (I feel like we have good film footage of games already), and what computation resources are needed? Would an M1Pro MacBook Pro handle this type of stuff?

This happened to me in 2018, my team went on a unexpected run at regionals and qualified for nationals.  Monday morning I asked my boss if I could have time off to attend nationals. I didn't give him a heads up because I didn't want to jinx my teams chances of making it. He denied my time off.  At noon I handed in my two weeks resignation letter. 

I attended nationals and it was the pinnacle of my playing career so far. 

I wouldn't recommend this if you have a spouse or children, I was single back in 2018.

what if this guy in your team keeps on doing it maybe once or twice a game ? 
i think he scored on one of his deep runs as a stack leader and now he thinks it's okay to keep on doing it. 

what if there's a handler in your team who loves running deep from time to time ?
without prior communication with his/her teammates.
it isn't a set play in our team he just does it and if the huck doesnt come out we are left scrambling cause no one is there for the swings. 
it rlly rlly is a hit or miss, when it connects the sidelines cheer and scream and i think it encourages him to do it more !

really interested in hearing many many different opinions on this ! (there's no stupid opinions in this thread)

# What is a Hat League?

We generate new teams each week based on those in attendance. Teams play two games against different opponents. Generally for the second game we have the winning teams play each other and the losing teams play each other. And then next week we do it all again with new teams. Due to the format, unlike most leagues, we do not have an end-of-season tournament or champion team.

# Background

We were noticing somewhat of a gap in playing opportunities for beginner players due to issues like cliquey team leagues, sandbagged draft leagues, and hyper-competitive, chippy play in ""rec"" leagues. What I image are all common problems.

What we came up with was the hat league format. New teams each week helped eliminate the worries of being the ""worst"" team in a  league, while also helping mitigate the competitive drive of needing to be the ""best"" team. It also means you get to meet and play with more people. We also added a teaching/learning aspect to our league where each week we have a new skill to learn and focus on. For example on week might be the vertical stack and the next will be zone defense.

This format by itself by no means completely eliminate the issues listed above, but we really try to emphasize that our league prioritizes having fun and learning over competition and winning. And we will talk to players if we feel their behavior is not within the spirt of the game and our league. In addition, since we don't have an end-of-season tournament and therefore a championship team, instead we have players and captains vote on ""spirit"" champions for the end of the season.

# Pros

* Overall receptions has been very positive
* We've had lots of players join that are brand new to the sport and are loving it
* A lot of interest from veteran players who want more structure than the chaotic nature of pick-up, but don't want to play at the competitive level of club or other leagues
* Easy to account for missing players as teams are guaranteed to have an equal number of players and balanced gender ratios. A huge relief if you've every been in charge of organizing teams and scrambling to find subs
* This format doesn't entirely alleviate stacked teams, but teams only exist for a week, so you never have to worry about teams dominating or getting dominated for the whole season

# Cons

* We check-in players in person as they arrive and then generate teams just before games starts. This can results in late starts as we wait for players to arrive, or having to add players to teams afterwards which can lead to unbalanced teams. This could be improved with a better setup, as currently we are just running things off a google spreadsheets and app scripts
* Some people don't feel like there is enough differentiating our league from just playing pick-up
* Players can feel less obligated to attend when they are not part of a specific team. Some weeks our attendance is on the low side, but we are also a new league and we play games on the weekend",ultimate,52,31,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/16jlhw7/hat_league/,ultimate,NA
2023-09-15,1694783640,"Rules Question: Mark recognizes downfield call, thrower doesn't","USAU.

Last night at practice as I was marking, I heard a pick called.  I said ""pick called"" but the thrower, who was very focused, did not seem to be registering what I said, so I said ""Stall 2, hey a pick was called, Stall 3, there was a pick..."" all the way to Stall 6.  (I am not arguing I was right/wrong to do that, just that's what I did).  At stall 6 the thrower's teammates finally got him to recognize the call downfield.  I have several questions:


1) In this exact scenario, what does the stall come in on?

2) If the thrower had thrown the disc (to a teammate uninvolved in the pick call) would the throw have counted?

3) If I had gotten to 10, would it be a stall?

Regionals are the second step of the postseason for teams in the USA Ultimate club series. Any team wishing to qualify for Nationals must participate at Regionals. Each region has a certain number of bids, ie. spots available at Nationals, which were obtained based on regular season performance. However, teams must still finish high enough at their respective Regionals in order to clinch their ticket to Nationals.

2023-09-12,1694495348,Can We Talk About Regionals Formats?,"It's the Monday after sectionals, we're all sore, we're all winding down from an awesome sectionals. Besides the torrential downpours both days, which no one could control, it was an awesome tournament and everyone had a great time. We qualified for regionals so we're hyped. Then we get the email with the regionals details. Because our region only has 2 bids, the only format approved by usau is a double elimination format that eliminates 10/16 teams by the end of Saturday. By the way, the bid fee is also $800, more than sectionals, a tournament where every team was guaranteed 7 games. Also the venue charges for parking. As a team not going to nationals, and who if we have a super good day could potentially make select flight (top 6 in a 2-bid region, we're guessing we'll be seeded 8th) but likely won't, this just seems like a huge money grab. I get that USAU has been trying to steer away from 8 games in a weekend, but in eliminating that they're sacrificing the enjoyment of regionals teams that aren't going to nationals. They're charging $800 for most teams showing up to play a single day and go home after that, and they picked a venue that charges us for parking?  


  
Honestly I'm fine with the bid fee, I'm fine with the parking cost. The field site is great I've played there before no complaints there. But the format is clearly catering towards nationals teams and getting them games rather than teams that earned their way to regionals but aren't going to nationals. Why can't we have a format that gets us more games against competitive opponents? I would definitely enjoy more pool play games and a bracket, but even if they just had more backdoor bracket games for lower teams to play, we go to regionals to play competition and our most optimistic trajectory if we are the 8 seed is to beat the 9, lose to the 1, beat the 10 seed, and lose to the 5 seed to end our regionals. We don't even get a backdoor game to get a chance to beat the 6 seed to get to select flight? The last time we played the team who will likely be the 5 seed we lost 15-8, the last time we played the team who will likely be the 6 seed we lost 15-13.",ultimate,47,41,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/16gidby/can_we_talk_about_regionals_formats/,ultimate,NA

2023-09-11,1694437942,Does a fake establish a pivot in WFDF?,"I was watching SGP vs NZL in the AOUGC mixed semifinals, where there were several contentious travel calls throughout the game called on SGP. As I was going back to re-watch some of the Singapore handlers, I noticed several times when the Singapore handlers would throw a fake while they had momentum from a catch, and afterwards move the foot that would become their pivot foot: for example  [https://youtu.be/6NVajzDkbI0?t=114](https://youtu.be/6NVajzDkbI0?t=114).

My initial reaction as a WFDF player who transitioned from USAU is that these were clearly travels. Under USAU, a [pivot has been established](https://usaultimate.org/rules/) when a fake is made:

&gt;Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a thrower's possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake

But when I was trying to find the corresponding rule/definition in WFDF, I didn't see an explicit mention of whether a fake establishes a pivot ([definition of pivot](https://rules.wfdf.org/definitions?start=20) &amp; [travel infractions](https://rules.wfdf.org/rules/2021/91-18-infractions-and-violations) 18.2.5; the WFDF website is a bit hard to search though). The most relevant rules I could find are 18.2.1 &amp; 18.2.2:

&gt;18.2.1. The thrower may attempt a pass at any time as long as they are entirely in-bounds or have established an in-bounds pivot point.  
&gt;  
&gt;18.2.2. After catching the disc, and landing in-bounds, the thrower must reduce speed as quickly as possible, without changing direction, until they have established a pivot point.

I'm not sure if ""attempt\[ing\] a pass"" includes faking or strictly refers to the disc leaving the player's hand, which is the WFDF definition of a pass.  So in WFDF, if you fake during your catching momentum, can you continue moving and then set a pivot? If so, does a large step forward during a fake with momentum constitute a change of speed?",ultimate,9,11,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/16fuxva/does_a_fake_establish_a_pivot_in_wfdf/,ultimate,NA

2023-10-08,1696806300,Tryouts for player with autism,"I hope it's OK to post this question here but I've always noticed that the ultimate community is such a supportive one, and I'm hoping you all might have some wisdom for my kid. He is a passionate high school player. He's an o-line handler on a top-ranked east coast high school team and a strong YCC team. He also has autism spectrum disorder. 

He's a beloved and valued teammate on his teams but he's completely lost when it comes to tryouts. On his teams he works his ass off, always makes the right throw, doesn't turn it over or clog up the field. At tryouts he does the same thing but seems to never get noticed. He has trouble understanding context clues and shifting social dynamics. So he just doesn't get the vibe of tryouts where he is supposed to call more attention to himself, to demand the disk, and show off a bit. He's bewildered by players at tryout who throw deep hucks into a crowd or cut into a teammate's space yet they do seem to do better in tryouts. Until you know him and see his passion and work ethic you might think he doesn't care that much. He really wants to play in college and his coaches say he has the skills to do that, but I know that tryouts are a big part of college ultimate, at least at some schools. 

So I am wondering if any of you out there have either experienced this challenge yourself or supported a player who can't figure out how to do tryouts. Do you have any wisdom or suggestions? I'm also aware that this isn't an autism sub so I'm happy to answer any questions or share what I've learned about that unique way of being in the world.",ultimate,48,69,0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/173cq3h/tryouts_for_player_with_autism/,ultimate,NA

Note: The app is completely free to download, and there is a free tier available with limited features, but the pro features are paid.

I look forward to you checking it out and your feedback. Thanks!",ultimate,8,6,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/171khgo/coaching_board_app_for_ultimate/,ultimate,NA

I'd use it for weekend tourneys, some of which require flights - in the past, I've packed a carry-on suitcase and folded my old soccer duffel inside, but I'd happily just bring a single bag on board. Would the 45L be big enough to carry gear, cleats, sneakers and civilian clothes for a weekend? The 30L? The 60L looks awfully big to be lugging around.

2023-10-06,1696562846,"Any strategies you recommend when 1 on 1? I thought of one really cool one, I think...","Not sure if this has been done (of course it has I just never seen anyone do it, in my games).

Starting Position: You catch the disc and establish a pivot foot. As a right-handed player, typically the left foot is the pivot foot for a backhand throw. But in your move, you're using the right foot as your pivot.

Initiating the Move: You begin to fake a backhand throw. The defender expects you to release a backhand throw, so they position themselves accordingly.

The Spin: Instead of throwing, you use your right foot to pivot and spin counterclockwise (to your left) 270. This move is unconventional and unexpected.

Ending Position: At the end of your spin, your back is against the defender. but you turn your head to the front and your side is against his side so between a 270 and 360 degrees. This position provides you with a wide-open forehand (flick) throw, especially to your right, since the defender is likely out of position to defend that space. you can also throw it straight ahead.

Im using Paint copy and paste so his legs are little wonky but that back leg is suppose to be his right (on the right image and his front foot is his left). anyone have any other moves either with the disc or defending or offense? something that gives them an edge on 1 on 1?

2023-10-05,1696493659,New Rec Team Forming: Tips for Quick Prep &amp; Strategy?,"Hey fellow ultimate enthusiasts! We're a newly-formed team of rec players, with some familiarity amongst us. We've got just two practice sessions over the next 10 days before we dive into a major tournament in 1.5 months, where we'll be up against both rec and league teams.

Given our limited prep time, here's our conundrum:
- Most of our crew has been playing for a few months. While they're familiar with moves like cutting, concepts like stacking or give-and-go are still quite new.
- We're blessed with good handlers and cutters, and many of us come from athletic backgrounds in other sports.

So, what would you recommend?
1. Should we focus on strategies like give-and-go, or perhaps try to grasp stacking? Or is it too ambitious given our time frame?
2. Do we prioritize getting to know each other's play styles on the field?
3. How about honing defensive techniques like forcing flicks or mastering defensive positioning?
4. Post our physical meetups, we still have a month leading up to the tourney, how do we effectively strategize remotely? 

We'd truly appreciate any guidance, drills, or tips that can help us make the most out of our prep time. Thanks in advance! >O",ultimate,7,6,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/170ce2v/new_rec_team_forming_tips_for_quick_prep_strategy/,ultimate,NA

2023-10-01,1696180142,(Rules) Defense after a pick is called?,"If a pick is called, and a pass is thrown before the thrower acknowledges the pick, the receiver still has to catch the disc, otherwise it's a turn. 

So even though a pick has been called, that receiver should keep playing at full speed and effort. Does this apply to everyone else as well? What if the defender on the intended receiver can make a play on the thrown disc, are they allowed to try and make that play?

What if the person who called a pick can still catch up and make a D? (Very floaty throw, say). What if the person on D who was picked could even go over and make a play on a very floaty throw to another player who they weren't originally guarding? 

In a pickup game, the last scenario happened. White #1 was picked while guarding Dark #1. I then threw a very floaty pass to Dark #2, which was caught for a score. White #1 said he stopped playing because a pick was called, but if he weren't picked, he could have gone over and D'ed my floaty pass, which was plausible imo.

Share Your Experiences!,"I've been brainstorming some fun variations to traditional ultimate and I'm curious to know if anyone here has tried playing any of them. If you have, I'd love to hear about your experiences, feedback, or even suggestions for tweaks. And of course, if you've got your own frisbee game variations, do share! 

**King of the Hill:** Essentially a ""winner stays"" setup. The team that scores becomes the defenders for the next round. Games are typically 1 point.  

**All-Hands Hustle:** Before a point can be scored, every member of the team must receive the frisbee at least once.  

**Twin Disc Duel**: Two frisbees in play! Points can be scored if either disc makes it to the goal, or only if both make it in. There's also an element of risk: if a disc is dropped, it can either result in a turnover for both or just the one that was dropped.  

**Secret Agent:** A fun twist on deception! One person on each team is designated as a secret agent, whose goal is to subtly sabotage their own team and aid the opponents. Each team is aware of their own spy, but the trick is not letting the other team figure it out!  

**Pivot Promenade:** When a player stops and catches the frisbee, they're allowed two steps and then they must pivot. Walking into the end zone with the frisbee is prohibited. 

Looking forward to hearing from you all! Cheers.

If anyone was wondering, you have to have a meaningful impact on the play in order for a pick call to stand.

""An infraction affected the play if an infracted player determines that the outcome of the specific play, from the time of the infraction until play stops, may have been meaningfully different absent the infraction. [[It is the infracted player's responsibility to announce if play was affected. For example, if a defender calls pick while trailing a receiver by 6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the pick affected the play. If the pick did not affect the play, the defender will still recover any distance lost, but the completed pass will stand. If the pick did affect the play, the disc reverts to the thrower.]]""

I want to host a tournament where if you have issues with this we can get around this problem.   


Possible solution what are your thoughts:  


""Ultimate"" Rulebook for the Great Frisbee Fiasco! >O

Games are split into halves. And at the start of each half a team must stick to either having a lady on the team or not. 

For Teams **Lacking Lady Luck**: 

On Offense:

Slim Pickings: If the score is tied or you're ahead start your offense a man down.

Full Deck Defense: Always have equal amount of players on defense. 

For Teams Graced with **Girl Power**:

Full Deck Offense: Always have equal amount of players on offense. 

Defensive Bonus: Score tied or lagging, roll out an extra player for defense. 

Extra rules:

Offense or Defense: Is determined by the start of a point. No popping in or out mid-point.   


What are your thoughts on this rule? Any other ways you have tried or suggest? I think this will keep it fair in that having an extra player on offense gives you a huge advantage so I didn't want to change that especially some teams have elite women. And I wanted to give an extra girl on defense because it's not fair to have a 6'3"" guy and a 5'2"" girl defending him.   


Another option I was thinking is that both teams are equal players at all times. However the team with girl can force a guy to be a handler. So if a team has a girl that girl can go up to any guy and force that opposing player to be a handler. That handler can only receive the frisbee laterally or backwards pass to him. This prevents the guy from dribbling and give and go and cutting all the way into the endzone.

been around the pick-up ulti scene for nearly 15 years and playing 4-6 days a week plus fundraiser tourneys and summer leagues since finishing undergrad. had an extended break amidst state of emergency until the covid vaccines came out, but I got back in shape after that and I'm now a better player (both athletically and skill-wise) than my college days.

Help me out understanding if I'm mistaken - I play WFDF and don't know the ins and outs of USAU.  
  
During the 4:4 point, there's a  XIST turn out the back. Hybrid brings it up to the goal line, throws a completed pass. The 2nd pass is a boost downfield, going OB nearly at the cone on the downwind side. No one on the field seems to notice that the first thrower had a travel called on him. D &amp; O players involved in that call disagree, go to Observer who confirms it is a travel. Disc is returned to the original thrower - turnover from 2nd is overruled, which seems like a pretty shitty outcome.  
  
Shouldn't 17.C apply here? ...""if the thrower fails to acknowledge the call and subsequently attempts a pass, play continues until the outcome of that pass is determined."" Doesn't that mean the turnover should stand? My understanding is 17.C has some different conventions about what it applies to (ie infractions vs violations?), whereas WFDF 16.3 basically says *any* call can be basically nullified if both teams agree the call didn't affect the outcome of the play.",ultimate,49,1,0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17d8i8b/hybrid_v_xist_travel_overrules_a_turn_no/,ultimate,NA

2023-10-21,1697870060,"A definitive guide to watching ultimate on ESPN+, including international options","###Watch ultimate on ESPN channels: A guide

---

For a few tournaments a year, ultimate is broadcast on an ESPN channel such as ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN+, etc. There are usually a number of folks with questions on how to watch ultimate on these platforms, so I've compiled a few of the most common questions and put them below for easy reference.

---

***Definitions***

---

- ESPN2 and ESPNU are traditional television channels. These can be watched on television or online.
- ESPN3 is an online-only platform that typically requires a cable TV package to access (or utilize a free workaround). Watch games through your computer, phone, or devices such as Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, etc.
- ESPN+ is an online-only platform that requires a standalone monthly subscription to access (or it can be bundled with other TV services like Disney+ and Hulu). ESPN+ does not include access to ESPN2, ESPNU, or ESPN3.

---

***When can ultimate be found on ESPN channels?***

---

The following tournaments usually broadcast games on an ESPN channel:

- D-I Championships (College)
- US Open (Club)
- Pro Championships (Club)
- National Championships (Club)

Typically, pool play games and early bracket play will be broadcasted by USA Ultimate or a third party such as [Ultiworld](https://ultiworld.com/live), while ESPN covers semifinals and finals.

---

***How can I watch ultimate on ESPN2 or ESPNU?***

---

ESPN2 and ESPNU games are easy to access since they are dedicated TV channels. Here are several methods:

- Just turn on your TV and cycle through. Your cable package may have it, even if you didn't realize.
- Go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) on your computer or the Watch section of the ESPN app and login with your cable TV credentials. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)
- Go to a bar or restaurant and ask a bartender/server to change the channel. Be patient and friendly.
- Google ""free ESPN2"" or ""free ESPNU stream"" or something similar. Look for sketchy-looking URLs and domain names. I'm serious - there are many sites streaming these channels for free, and they ALL have dodgy URL names. Just close any pop-ups that appear. A couple sites I recommend are tv247us[dot]com/watch/espn-u/ and bigbro8fan[dot]weebly[dot]com.

---

***How can I watch ultimate on ESPN+?***

---

Unlike the other ESPN platforms, there are essentially no free workarounds to watching ultimate on ESPN+. On the bright side, it's very easy to set up and watch:

1. Go to [Plus.ESPN.com](https://plus.espn.com/) and follow the steps. The cost is $10/month for the standard bundle or $13/month for a bundle including Disney+ and Hulu. There are no free trials.
2. Once subscribed, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with your credentials. You can also watch ESPN+ on [a variety of devices and apps](https://help.espnplus.com/espnplus_hc?id=espnplus_article_content&amp;article=espn-plus-supported-devices) including the ESPN app on your phone.
3. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)

**Cost-Saving Methods**

- Annual plans include two months free.
- [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com/) offers cash back on monthly and annual plans.
- Verizon customers with a 5G Get More or 5G Play More plan may qualify for [free access.](https://www.verizon.com/support/disney-bundle-faqs/#eligible)

---

***How can I watch ultimate games on ESPN3?***

---

**If you have a cable package with ESPN3 access, it's easy:**

- Go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) on your computer or the Watch section of the ESPN app and login with your cable TV credentials. To find ultimate, scroll through the 'Also Live' section (you may need to click [See All](https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/29971/also-live)). You can also try searching directly for 'ultimate' or 'USA' or click a direct link on the [USAU broadcast page.](https://usaultimate.org/watch/broadcast-schedule/)

**If you don't have a cable package with ESPN3 access, there are several workarounds:**

1. First, if you have ANY cable package, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login, just in case. Sometimes ESPN3 is complimentary, or you have an ESPN package you don't know about.
2. If you have access to a college campus or military base, simply connect to its wifi and visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) above. ESPN3 is free and included for most colleges and military bases in the US.

    Note: You can often access college campus wifi even if you're not a student. Connect to the Guest wifi or ask at the local visitor center. For military base wifi, just hop the fence or charge the gate. Free access for a year or more.
3. Try a free trial of a service that includes ESPN3 access, such as [Fubo](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome), [Hulu TV](https://www.hulu.com/live-tv), or [Youtube TV](https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/). Some of these services may let you register for a new free trial on the same account/card if enough time has passed. After subscribing, visit [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with your account credentials, or follow the instructions of the respective TV service.
4. If nothing else, try a bootleg stream. [RareTode](https://www.twitch.tv/raretode) (/u/saswink) often streams games. Other users are [EatPrayFartSomeMore](https://www.twitch.tv/eatprayfartsomemore) (/u/EatPrayFart) and [Sascha](https://www.youtube.com/user/bandninja27) (/u/ultimatesascha). These links have worked in the past: TV247US[dot]com/espn-3,  tv247[dot]us/espn-3/, MyGoodStream[dot]pw/espn. Finally, try [this suggestion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/dncmvh/europeans_usa_nationals_is_available_on_espn/f59rwrp/?context=3)

***I'm an international viewer. How can I watch?***

---

For years watching ultimate on ESPN channels has been difficult if not impossible for international viewers. In 2023 USAU introduced a solution, offering a paid package covering the ESPN games for individuals outside the United States. The package varies per event but is usually $10-12. [Click here to buy it.](https://usaultimate.vhx.tv/)

Note: The site apparently has a geofence that prevents users in the United States from watching, but I'm curious how rigid that is, or if it could be exploited with a VPN like [Hola](https://hola.org/). If anyone tests it, let me know.

**Other Options for International Viewers:**

If USAU is not offering a paid package for international viewers, you may still have some options to watch ESPN games. First, try the steps listed above for the respective ESPN channel. You never know, it just might work. If it fails, some common troubleshooting methods are below:

- If you are not allowed to register for a service due to your location, try using a VPN such as [Hola](https://hola.org/) (free) or Express VPN (paid). You can also try [this non-VPN method.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/cllldg/any_kind_american_soul_streaming_the_us_open_on/evxu303/)
- If you are not allowed to register for a service due to not having a US credit card, try using Paypal or buy a Google Play gift card and use that.

You can also try a free trial of [ESPN Player.](https://www.espnplayer.com/) This is an official service provided by ESPN to viewers in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/qe8qzd/psa_how_to_watch_the_espn3_streams_from_europe/) for more details. Note that ultimate is [not always offered](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/qerrzc/reply_by_espn_support_regarding_international/) on ESPN Player.

---

***The event is over. Can I still watch the ESPN games?***

---

Probably, and you might have to wait.

- If you have ESPN access, go to [ESPN.com/Watch](https://www.espn.com/watch/) and login with whatever method you have or open the ESPN app on your phone. Go to [Schedule &amp; Replays](https://www.espn.com/watch/schedule), click [Replay](https://www.espn.com/watch/schedule/_/type/replay), then use the filters to find the games. However, some games may not be viewable, even if they have direct links to the games. [See this thread for details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/rq0fy8/is_it_true_that_it_is_impossible_to_rewatch_the/)
- If you don't have ESPN access, or the games aren't listed or viewable online, try visiting USAU's [Watch page](https://usaultimate.org/watch/playlist/full-games/) or [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/usaultimate) account. There may be a delay of anywhere from a few days to a few weeks before games get uploaded here.",ultimate,8,13,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17cwajq/a_definitive_guide_to_watching_ultimate_on_espn/,ultimate,NA

2023-10-17,1697555896,Rule question on double team,"Here's a situation that came up in rec league a couple of weeks ago. 

Turnover, offense picks it up with a backhand mark. Person starting to run deep (only ten yards downfield, maybe ten yards behind the mark). Another defender starts to chase them but cuts through the throwers space (as in, directly by them from dump spot directly through throwing lane). The thrower chooses to throw and the defender blocks the throw as they run directly past. Not a handblock or even an intentional reaction to get a block, but a ""got hit by the throw while inside the ten feet"". 

We didn't know what to call it. The defender admitted to intentionally running through the space to disrupt the throw. They weren't reacting to an offensive player they were actively covering (but reacting to one ten yards away). Double team wasn't called because of how quickly it happened. 

Can this be a foul/double-team to get the disc back? Is it just a turn because the thrower chose to make the throw? If it's a turn, is this a sneaky (unspirited) loophole of brief double-team without a penalty?

I guess a general situation is: if a defender double teams the thrower (cup, poach, etc) and the thrower throws anyway and it's blocked by the double-teamer, is it just a turn? Does the thrower have the obligation to call double team (and just get the slight stall back) or just not throw it? 

(One thing the AUDL got right is to get rid of double-teams to prevent the arbitrary distance/enforcement, but low level ultimate would be a mess if double-team is allowed!)

2023-10-15,1697339850,Do and Don't for pick up ultimate,"Recently playing a new game of ultimate pick up that has the standard array of player types from athletic individuals who can throw well to retired players who are getting some exercise with some good chucks, and everything in between. So the reason for my post: I have received some comments about how hard I play, especially on defense (as though I am trying too hard or using too much strategy). In my opinion, not playing too hard, especially if I am playing against someone with an obvious skill difference (I am a tall, athletic player with okay throws). I do tend to position myself to take away unders when I can, and poach when the opportunity presents itself though. 

I wanted to open a discussion about what people feel like is or is not acceptable for pick up. Is poaching okay? Boxing out on 50/50s? Strict and honest man defense where you only guard deep?

2023-10-14,1697275338,Tips Needed for Tracking and Catching High Throws While on Full Sprint in Ultimate Frisbee?,"I'm looking to up my game when it comes to catching those high throws during intense moments on the field. Picture this: I go for a massive cut, the frisbee soars way above me, and I'm sprinting at full tilt. I can spot the frisbee while running, but the real challenge hits when I have to turn my head at the last second and lose sight of it. This gets even trickier when the frisbee takes an unexpected turn right at the end.

So, I'm reaching out to this amazing community for some expert advice. How do you all manage to read the trajectory of the frisbee while running flat out? Any tips, tricks, or techniques that can help me track the frisbee better when I have to turn my head or body to catch it? Often, I find myself looking over my shoulder while sprinting and then having to make a quick head-turn, and last second adjustments which makes catching incredibly challenging.

I've scoured the internet for videos and resources, but most of what I find focuses on throwing hucks, not catching them when they're full overhead and require twisting your head and body. Any recommendations on specific drills, videos, or reading material that could help me improve in this area?

Your expertise and insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer. ",ultimate,21,14,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/177lkjv/tips_needed_for_tracking_and_catching_high_throws/,ultimate,NA

We run vert, ho and endzone vert on offense. And man and our brand of zone on defense. That's it.

This is due to several different reasons, the main being the fact that we don't have any kind of coaching outside of us teaching ourselves and that usually around half our roster is made up of rookies who have little to no ultimate experience going into their first year in college, so we have to spend much of the Fall semester teaching them the basics of the sport.

We usually get by in the early stages of games and tournaments with what we have, but teams realize this and adjust, and our production sharply drops in the later stages. So, my question is. What could be our next step in tactics? What are some different looks/plays/stacks that we could implement that are simple enough for people with less than a year of playing experience to learn and understand?

2023-10-11,1697050032,Players are unmotivated& what can we do?,"using a throw away because i don't want people to trace it back to my team. 

I played with my high school girls team from sophomore/senior year. I graduated in 2019, then went to college. This year, I graduated from college, and the girl's team needed a coach. I decided to take the job and do that alongside my year long internship I have. 

My high school team in the past has been well known for its talent and has produced several renown players. But right now& the club is struggling. When I was in high school, we had about five guys teams and two-ish girls teams. Now, we're down to a varsity, a JV, and half of a girls team, who now plays mixed with varsity. 

The main problem right now with the varsity team is that they just don't care. That's not to say all of them don't. Of course, we have 9-10 boys who are extremely dedicated and attend whenever they can, and my girls are fantastic at showing up and putting in effort. However, the other kids don't show up, and don't tell the coaches they're not going to show up. And when they show up, they're not putting in the effort they need to. The coaches have tried everything - sprints, playing time restrictions, etc. But they just don't show up. They're not motivated at all. We have a little over 20 boys rostered on varsity, but only 7-9 show up per practice. 

The coaches of varsity have told me they're sort of at their wits end. I'm afraid if this continues, we straight up won't have a club anymore. We can't get recruits (and trust me, WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING - the former founder of the club was a science teacher at the high school, but he left a few years back and is no longer part of the club, now we don't have any teachers/insiders at the school). 

How do we motivate these kids? An idea was pitched about possibly booting kids to the B team, but I'm afraid that'll just make them show up less. Is there anything we can do?",ultimate,32,32,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/175lma7/players_are_unmotivated_what_can_we_do/,ultimate,NA

We've been working on this book for four years! It's our love letter to this sport and the whole ultimate community. We'll come back and let you know when the Kickstarter goes live on October 16 -- this is gonna knock your socks off.

In the meantime... We're pretty new to redditing, so please let us know if there's anything you'd like to see from us or know about the book! Do you have questions? Do you want to see some more art or previews? Let us know here or reach out to us (@ContestedStrip) on our socials.

&gt;He \[Pawel Janas\] dove into contact with a passing defender as he threw a backhand: predictably, the contact resulted in a bad throw. It would have also been a foul and given the disc back to Janas  except that he had been called for a travel on the play before the contact occurred. The observers ruled that the travel call was correct and that it pre-empted the contact. Therefore the result of the play was a turnover.

I don't think the full game is on YouTube yet, but the full play is in [the highlights here](https://youtu.be/nfKhl6XfPqM?si=Ul4navwB41eAJXS_&amp;t=850). It looks and sounds to me like the observer call is just that the disc is out of Janas' hand when it hits #8 Edmonds, and so is a straightforward no foul.

But I'm confused by the Ultiworld description. If indeed there was a travel call, the Continuation Rule would apply, no? 17.C.4 *Play stops when the thrower in possession acknowledges that an infraction has been called.* Since the thrower attempts a throw, they haven't acknowledged the infraction, and so play hasn't stopped, in which case 17.H applies: *If multiple infractions occur on the same play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved in reverse sequence (latest infraction first, earliest infraction last).*

That would seem pretty clear that the foul needs to be resolved, and not simply dismissed because the travel happened.

2023-10-28,1698464696,"Strips, the misunderstood middle child","We've all been there at pickup - Someone sends you a soft throw just a little too high to the force side. You track it but your defender's getting closer. You reach out with one hand, you touch the disc first, you close your grasp. You can almost taste the catch before you sauce an inevitable upline blade for a score. But the defender has more momentum and catches the disc with just a little more strength. They touched it after you but against all odds come away with the disc. Having ruined your plans for throwing that sweet continuation to take half, you blurt strip. You don't say much else for a few seconds, but you start making sock puppet hand motions before pleading that you got there first. The defender has to choose one of two responses: Be an asshole and tell them they're full out it, or smile and hand the disc back and say ya, you got it first. Everybody claims to know what a strip is because this scenario plays out like clockwork every Sunday morning and Tuesdays after dark.

But is this really what the writers of the usau rulebook envisioned when they documented the strip as a self officiated call? Let's review the definitions in the rulebook:
Strip - when a foul causes a player to lose possession
Possession - sustained contact with, and control of, a non spinning disc
With those two definitions in mind, we know we need to rethink all strip calls as a subset of fouls. And sustained contact is incredibly vague, so we're on our own there.

Hot take #1 - For a strip to happen, there has to be a foul simultaneously called.

Every strip call and subsequent pleading of a case should be accompanied by a foul call. Strip or I caught it first mean absolutely nothing. If you caught it first, what prevented you from having possession a second or so later? Did the player committing the strip bump your back or elbow? Did they make a dangerous play that would have created contact if you hadn't backed off? Now those would be real grounds for making a strip call, per the rulebook.

If you've read this far, you either think I'm full of shit, or you actually follow the logic and want to know where it ends up.

Hot take #2 - If two players both go for a disc without either commiting a receiving foul/dangerous play (a different topic and conversation), it shouldn't matter who touches the disc first or even who catches it first. Nobody has sustained contact when it is a bang bang play.

Let's play out a scenario between 2 players, it doesn't matter who is on O or D:
Player 1 attempts a catch and initially stops rotation of the disc and it is noticeably before player 2's hand(s) make any contact with the disc. But a split second after player 1 has some established control of the disc, player 2 now also has partial control. Jostling over control for another split second, player 2 actually comes away with complete control of the disc. Player 2 does not commit a foul on player 1's ability to receive and has only manipulated  the disc itself. As per above, there would be no justification behind a strip call because there is no foul occurring to have caused said strip. Award it to player 2.",ultimate,37,0,0.28,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17i5amu/strips_the_misunderstood_middle_child/,ultimate,NA

I watch a lot of esports and it's been pretty brutal seeing teams and even whole leagues fold as VCs realize how expensive and unprofitable teams are. 

Obviously esports are pretty different than the audl as the scale of investment is much larger and investors in esports expect a return at some point while audl owners may just do it for love of the game. 

Audl doesn't really pay players anything meaningful, so maybe the losses aren't significant enough break teams.

But I want to ask about the USAU rules that would govern a different, hypothetical (and uncontested) set of facts. 

Receiver is stripped while airborne, directly above their attacked end zone while cutting and laying out back toward the thrower.  That is, all relevant body parts and the disc are within the End Zone if viewed from above, but nothing's actually touching down on the End Zone surface. The strip contact doesn't alter their path through the air, and they land (let's say their non-catching hand makes first contact) in the Central Zone, not the End Zone. Under[ ] USAU Rules (12.A.2, 17.C.3.b.1, and 17.I.4.b.2 seem relevant) it looks to me like the receiver would be awarded the disc at the playing field location closest to the foul, ie in the End Zone.  Rather than at their Central Zone landing spot. But under Rule 12 (by omission), not awarded a goal; rather, they'd have to carry the disc back out to the goal line and throw from there. 

Is that right?  It seems a bit odd (albeit rarely consequential) that they wouldn't instead get possession at their Central Zone landing spot.",ultimate,14,7,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17g6g57/outcome_of_strip_while_o_jumping_from_end_zone_to/,ultimate,NA

I recently moved to a new community after playing in Toronto for a year and a half. I didn't notice great spirit in Toronto's rec leagues, but over the summer, I've seen some wonderful examples of spirit (shoutout to GRADA and their Zodiac tournament!) that keep me coming back to the game. However, the level of spirit I observed over the summer really needs to be cultivated within a community, and I'm looking for some entry-level ideas that can be brought into a league that doesn't have a strong culture of spirit. 

I recently became the spirit captain for a team in my local development league, and I am looking for some ideas that I can implement that would feel genuine and comfortable given my recent involvement in the sport and the lower level of spirit in my community. Right now, teams cheer for the other team after a game about 50% of the time. There's one team in my league that choose a spirit winner on the opposing team after each game and gives them a treat. I think this is a great idea, but I'm looking for other similar ideas. I am hoping to bring a few ideas to my team and we can pick something that feels right for us. 

I'm coming to you all as my experience in ultimate is limited. What are some moderate spirit ideas that you've seen that might work in a situation like this?

2023-10-24,1698155888,Does Dangerous Play give offense the right to always make a play on the disc?,"I've noticed this tread a lot where the receiver on offense calls dangerous play when the throw to them is off-target and the defense collides with them as they try to adjust to get the disc. Often times, the defense already has a line on the errant throw. Does the offense always have the right to adjust to the disc if the defense already has committed to getting the block? Shouldn't defense have right of way if they recognize the errant throw first and adjust first (or happen to already be going the right direction)?

This happened during the Lawless vs Crocs pool play game. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2cAGmgWzLw&amp;t=2419s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2cAGmgWzLw&amp;t=2419s). The sequence of events are (as I see it):

1. Defender was poaching the lane, but starts moving back to their offender (the dump).
2. The dump starts moving away from their returning defender to maintain spacing.
3. The handler throws to the dump but the throw is slightly short and inside (where the dump was originally set).
4. Defender sees they have a line on the disc and lays out.
5. The dump tries to curl back to the disc and reach over the bidding defender.
6. The dump gets hit in the ankle and calls dangerous play.
7. Defender doesn't contest (and gets a yellow card).

But if the offense didn't make the play because they saw the throw was off-target and that the defender was already bidding, then they wouldn't have been hit. Defense definitely established their line first and offense only moves back once they realize the throw isn't going to their original motion.",ultimate,58,42,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17fdgzx/does_dangerous_play_give_offense_the_right_to/,ultimate,NA

2023-10-23,1698104606,"Do Elite ""Mercenary"" Players in Ultimate stifle local growth?","There is no restriction on where a player chooses to play in USAU. And if someone has the means, the drive, and the goal to make it to Regionals/Nationals or win a championship with a team outside of their local area, there are no rules preventing them. Being a mercenary is especially incentivizing if the mercenary's local community is nowhere near the level of play the mercenary wishes to be at. But do elite or top-end mercenary players prevent growth in their local communities as a result of not playing locally.

For example, I heard one of the announcers at Nationals say that Matt Rehder was commuting from St. Louis, MO to play with Ring of Fire -- this team had a chance to be in or winning Finals but finished with an amazing semis result at Nationals. But if Matt Rehder intentionally takes a step down to shepherd a local open team like Lounar in 2023, could that accelerate the growth of the local men's ultimate in St. Louis?

Raleigh-Durham United (RDU) has a respectable pre-quarters finish at Nationals along with finishing 11th in rankings and close games against top teams. Obviously, there is a lot of history and program building in North Carolina ultimate, and this isn't to take away from the building of RDU as a program, finishing in 2022 with a backdoor game-to-go loss at Southeast Regionals. But Brett Matzuka was a huge addition to the RDU roster for 2023 and lives locally in Raleigh. Brett is an extremely talented player and (more importantly for this post) teacher of the game.

I'm curious what percent is represented in the community, in mixed or womxns, and how biological females feel when they match up against a mtf player?

2023-10-22,1697994257,"Josh ""Cricket"" Markette - A Tribute","While ultimate media has grown, we're still at the point where there are lots of important stories in the sport aren't being told. I'd like to take a moment to recognize my friend and living legend, Josh ""Cricket"" Markette.

Last night, Josh was inducted into the Hall of Fame for ultimate. Within that most elite of clubs in ultimate, he joins one of the most notable and remarkable classes of players - a group that now only has two players - players who were inducted into the Hall while still playing at Club Nationals.  The only previous player to have achieved that is, of course, the indomitable Dominique Fontenette.

Josh is 44 years old, he'll be 45 next month.  He has played on the top club Team in his city (Atlanta and then Boston) since 2000.  For almost all of those years, he's been a starter on the O-line of those teams.  He's won titles in both cities (Chain 2009, Ironside 2016).  In Friday nights DiG-Truck Stop game which ended in controversy, Josh was on the field for Double Game Point. If things had gone differently, we could be seeing him play today in a meaningful role for another national championship.

It is hard to overstate what a feat it is to play at this level for this many years in this sport.  Ultimate is physically demanding and to compete at a nationals level requires hours and hours of training each year.  For most of us, that level of physical commitment takes a toll. And, while I imagine this subreddit leans much younger than 44, aging is a quiet thief of athleticism. Every year it gets harder and harder to get to your peak physical shape and that peak lowers.  For most of us, that seems to speed up at 40. Not only that, Josh recovered from a broken leg *just this past spring* to return to the nationals field.  Josh has been Masters eligible for 15 years (and has also won 2 Masters titles) and Grand Masters eligible for 5.

To put in perspective the length of Josh's play at the level he's been at:

* Josh is the same age as Hall of Famer Alex Nord who ten year's ago Hector Valdivia wrote about in a classic piece called ""[they don't know Nord](https://skydmagazine.com/2013/05/they-dont-know-nord/)""
* Josh was a 5 year veteran on Chain Lightning when George Stubbs (HoF lock) and Grant Lindsley (himself very much an elder statesmen of the sport) were rookies
* Countless Nationals players at Club Nationals this year *were not even born yet* when Josh first started playing on a nationals level team

While his longevity is mind-blowing, what is somehow easy to miss about Josh is just how incredibly good he has been for all of these years.  When most players begin declining as they approach 30, Josh seemed to only improve.  He was an exceptional player for Chain when they won their title in 2009 (at age 30), most observers would argue he's been better every year since then.

It's widely accepted that we don't have great stats in ultimate - goals and assists simply don't capture impact (although in 2021 Josh led DiG in points at Nationals).  In 2013, Ultiworld for one year only took ""advanced stats"" - tracking yardage and expected contribution (offensive/defensive/total) and Josh's results (19.4 yards per/possession, 96.4% completion percentage) put him on [Ultiworld All-Club first team](https://ultiworld.com/2013/11/01/ultiworlds-club-first-team-open/) (who else was on it? Beau, Kurt, Ashlin, Mickle, Mark Lloyd, and Danny Karlinsky).  Josh would go on to make all-club two more times including [Offensive Player of the year in 2016](https://ultiworld.com/2016/10/13/2016-mens-club-awards-presented-ultimate/) (he was 37 at this point!!).

His play has always been unassuming and effortless, belying his transcendent talent on the field. He is one of the greatest throwers in the game with a creativity and an understanding of the disc that few can even comprehend.  He's adaptable and can move easily between the backfield and downfield. He's one of the sneakiest and quickest cutters the sport has ever seen. And his game can compliment anybody, elevating the play of those around him.

Josh is also one of the most enjoyable teammates and opponents in the sport.  The year Ironside won Nationals, Josh was the team's Farricker Award nominee.  He's clever, candid, and has a disarming self-deprecating sense of humor that makes him easy to love.  To get a glimpse into his personality, you should [read this interview](https://ultiworld.com/2015/09/28/on-winning-losing-and-confidence-an-interview-with-josh-cricket-markette/) with him that he did with Charlie back in 2015.

For those of you that might follow the sport and know the biggest names, it's possible that Josh has flown under your radar.  I hope, if you're the type of person who watches old games, you'll take some time to go back and watch him do what he does - it doesn't always jump of the screen, but it's always impressive.  And, if Josh comes back for another year, keep an eye on what the old man does.

And if you read this far, you get this treat of an [18 year old Josh teaching you how to throw](https://youtu.be/Ba2nPw7nbJE?feature=shared&amp;t=215).

With Love,

Kyle

Next, we're going to get people amped up over controversy because you're not gonna rule 1 correct strip call all weekend.

2023-10-21,1697928923,USAU needs VAR for top level observed games,"USAU + Ultiworld has reached this point where there is so much media coverage available during the top-level games (from both official ultiworld and unofficial folks like ultiphotos, nkolakovic, cleary, akrajan, etc.) that there should be an added VAR observer position.

One observer should be added with tent access to the official Ultiworld footage screens for VAR review and be on radio with the on-field observers.

On field media coverage should be given flags or some identifying object so that if they find that their photo/video coverage has clear evidence that observers should see, they should raise their flag / identifying object and an on-field observer should check-in with the media folk before going to make a decision. Not sure if observers already have both mic and headset, but if they do, they should be able to communicate with each other from distance without having to huddle in one spot to discuss.

Obviously this is going to be more difficult to implement than said. But at the level of footage we are getting now, USAU should really consider adding these for the big games like semis and finals.

\*Edit: **To clarify, I don't mean using VAR to actively make calls. I mean using VAR to ensure that observer rulings are 100% confident and correct. Observers, from what I understand, should only interject when called upon, and when asked to give a ruling, they should be 100% confident in the call they are about to make, or they should be saying, hey I'm not confident it's going to have to be contested.** Observers are human, they can't see everything and they won't always get everything right.

2023-11-15,1700081915,Help with Forehand technique,"Hi all - would greatly appreciate some advice/critique on my forehand. 

Background: I'm a 52-year old guy who played mid-level club ultimate about 25 years ago, and I'm just getting back into the game after 15+ years away from the sport. I've been enjoying playing local pickup and leagues, but will likely never play at a competitive/tournament level again for various reasons not worth going into. However, I'd still like to optimize my performance within my current limitations. I've got plenty of time to work on throwing form (I practice throwing about 3-4 days/week for an hour or so - either with a friend or throwing into a net) and I'm specifically looking for tips on how to improve my forehand technique.  


When I compare myself to better throwers, I notice the most significant difference in form is that they tend to end their throwing motion with their arm low and slightly in front of their legs, and get much more of a ""whip"" effect from stopping their arm motion and snapping back, whereas I'm throwing more across my body, with a flatter motion and more follow through - and not generating nearly as much ""snap"" because my arm continues across my body instead of stopping and snapping back. This works OK for me up to about 30-40 yards, but if I want to improve my distance I think I need to adjust my form. Unfortunately I have many years of muscle memory behind this technique so it's very challenging to adjust and when I try to emulate ""good"" forehand form (ie, something like this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqHmC-xIZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXqHmC-xIZ0)), my throws are terrible. I've watched tons of videos of form analysis and instruction, so I have a pretty good idea what to do but I'm finding it hard to adjust.  


SO, a couple of questions: is it even worth it to try to make adjustments to match the form of better throwers? Should I accept that my current form is ""good enough"" for my level of play (ie: I have pretty accurate forehands up to about 30-40 yards) or should I work on making some adjustments?  


Any specific tips/cues on how to adjust my form?  


Here's a video from today - the first few throws are me, the second thrower is my buddy who has a more powerful, though less accurate, forehand than mine, and his form looks much more like what Rowan is doing in the clip above.

2. Some throwers who do show a ""palm up"" during their follow through (Jimmy Mickle and Michael Ing are the examples I use in the article) **only turn their palm up after the disc is released**, and thus turning their palm up can't be affecting the flight path of their throw.

2023-11-08,1699468751,Dealing with Foul Calls,"My son plays for a very strong high school team and it can get pretty competitive during tournament play.  Over the last couple of years, his team has faced the same opponent in the Semi's or Finals of a few regional tournaments.  This opponent is also a very talented team so it's usually a good matchup.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem my son is having is that this opponent seemingly call fouls on every other point.  Picks, travelling, strips, areal contact, out of bounds, made catches/drops - you name it.  Case and point:  At a recent tourney, of the first (7) games played, there were a total of 4 fouls called against our team.  During the 8th and final game, there were (7) fouls called against us - IN THE 1ST HALF and they were almost all on scoring or change of possession plays.  Not a flash in the pan either - over the last 3 times we faced this team, we've been called for a total of 18 fouls to our 4 calls.  I wouldn't categorize our team as overly aggressive or creating dangerous plays either.  Our coach has tried to have a friendly conversation with the opponents coach but this guy is a bit of a red ass - which is where this teams identity likely comes from.   These incessant foul calls ruin the flow of the game and often leads to chippy play.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other tips or pointers that might help ease this situation?

2023-11-07,1699400559,Dangerous Plays,"My take on dangerous plays.

After watching many ultimate games since this rule came out it seems like it is too common for people to try and blame one player or the other that was involved in a dangerous play and almost never the thrower. (Clearly there's some cases where there is more blame) Sometimes I think we should just say hey, this was a dangerous situation, no one in particular is at fault, lets just redo it, rather than spending all this time arguing and belittling someone else. It is unfortunate when an injury occurs and we should do our best to avoid collision and be more aware of our surroundings on the field, but no one has 360 vision and the field changes quickly and no one is perfect. We have set the standard so high, probably right in doing so because bad injuries are the outcome, but now it seems no one considers the other perspective.

When two players which have disproportionate athletic abilities occupy the same field it increase the odds of dangerous plays. Either the less athletic one cannot control their body as well and ends up creating dangerous plays or they are unaware that the other player can control their body well and the less athletic player calls dangerous play when one didn't really exist.

In mixed games I believe mmp have a higher responsibility to avoid collisions because of their significant size difference, speed and ability to change directions more quickly. This doesn't always mean they are at fault when there's a dangerous play between a mmp and a fmp but they do carry extra responsibility, in my opinion. Players are choosing to be on those teams and both should be aware of the responsibilities and risks that may associated with it.

In summary - avoid contact, be in control of your body, mmp and male fmp should place extra care when sharing the field with fmp, look at all the perspectives before going crazy on someone, sports are dangerous but we should do our part to minimize the danger.",ultimate,17,9,0.58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17q84qa/dangerous_plays/,ultimate,NA

2023-11-06,1699310643,Spirit and Social Emotional Learning for Self-Officiation,"Spirit lacks a universal definition that is accepted but can be tied with the concept of being treated ""fair."" Spirit is also an integral component to self-officiation. I think the social emotional learning concept of a win-win resolution helps games achieve more games with fair calls. Let's explore a hypothetical scenario where Team A is playing Team B.

In the first scenario where Team A and Team B are both self-officiating fairly (and fair is subjective to those participating in the game), this game will proceed in a spirited way as perceived by those teams. This does not necessarily mean an observer, arbiter, or spectator of that game will perceive the game as fair and spirited.

In the second scenario where Team A is self-officiating fairly and Team B is not self-officiating fairly, there are a couple of options for Team A who believe the game is unfair: Team A will do nothing; Team A will start self-officiating in a similar unfair manner to Team B (proceed to the third scenario below); or Team A will raise a concern with Team B (e.g., spirit circle, talk to their captain, yell at Team B, etc.). 

In the third scenario, Team A &amp; Team B are not self-officiating fairly. These games tend to be toxic and injury-prone because Team A and Team B both feel the game is unfair unless action is taken to cause Team A &amp; Team B to self-officiate fairly.

A win-win call resolution is one that is fair and maintains spirit of the game; a win-win call resolution does not imply that both teams get an advantage. The key driver for most games being relatively fair and spirited relies on the win-win resolution: if Team A makes a fair call, Team B will be more likely to make a fair call in the future to maintain spirit of the game. Team A and Team B would prefer that the game does not devolve into the third scenario where there are negative physical, emotional, and/or social repercussions that occur during and well-beyond the game because past experiences of the third scenario may have left a bad taste, injury, etc. This is the value proposition that might cause might cause Team B to start playing fairly in the second scenario IF a concern is raised by Team A to try to reach the first scenario and a win-win.

A caveat to this is the temporal aspect that many of us have seen. Let's say 95% of the game abides by the first scenario, but on the final point of the game, Team B decides to make an unfair call in their advantage. Team B is less impacted by the win-win resolution of a fair call within the time of the game because the game will be over soon (e.g., Team A may not have an opportunity to make future calls or react in an unfair way physically, socially, or emotionally during the final moments of the game). The only reason that Team B would want to make a win-win, fair call in this scenario is to maintain their social and emotional reputation beyond the confines of the game.

2023-11-06,1699287567,positions in ultimate and what skills make someone a good fit for them,"I was talking to a teammate recently about different positions on the field and i'm now curious. I have always known that there are cutters and handlers, and in a zone you will find more specific positions like the deep-deep, mid-mid, wings (left/right mids), poppers, people in the cup and such but I have also recently heard the term striker being used a lot more as well. I was wondering if someone maybe had any ideas on what skills are best for each position since i've found that most players tend to stick to a certain role. For example I tent to be the mark in the cup and when on O i'm a cutter but people often call me a striker but i'm not exactly sure how the two differ. Obviously speed and throwing ability have something to do with it and if you tend to be on an O or D line but im curious if there are more subtle skills like how far you can throw, etc. If anyone has thoughts on what skills make one players better at a certain position than others id love to hear it",ultimate,15,33,0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/ultimate/comments/17p6eja/positions_in_ultimate_and_what_skills_make/,ultimate,NA

I still think Manu is a slightly better athlete overall though. They both can work in any space on the field and both have great field sense and awareness of what is happening around them.

2023-10-29,1698608949,Drama in ultimate: a refresher,"In light of the events in the Machine-Bravo semi-final, it occurred to me that many of the people commenting on Reddit and elsewhere may not have been around for Lou Burruss' blog post series [How to Cheat to Win Without Cheating](http://winthefields.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-cheat-to-win-without-cheating_20.html). It's an excellent reminder that many teams will choose to bend the rules in order to give themselves a competitive advantage. Johnny Bansfield shoving Alex Atkins in the back is a clear example of how ultimate is not immune to the same types of behaviors and attitudes that are prevalent in other sports.

As some people have pointed out in other places, there are examples of instigators in other sports. Burrus calls these players [lightning rods](http://winthefields.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-to-cheat-to-win-without-cheating_12.html). In hockey these players are called ""pests"", but this role exists across other sports in the form of trash talking (Michael Jordan and Larry Bird in basketball, Muhammad Ali in boxing), overaggressive play that pushes the limits of the rules (Faf de Klerk in rugby), and just generally being a huge pain to the other team. Ultimate is still at the impasse as to how to deal with these players who work in this liminal space and while taunting behavior or trash talking isn't something that most casual players are okay with, at the higher levels you can usually find at least one on each time. Atkins and Jagt were thrown out as examples, but there are plenty of examples across all divisions (I'd say it's less prevalent in women's, though) and countries (WFDF ultimate is not immune to this by any means).

The goal of these players is to create [drama](http://winthefields.blogspot.com/2010/10/how-to-cheat-to-win-without-cheating_20.html), to make the other team lose focus on winning the game and instead start thinking about how the instigator is a huge pain to deal with. Bansfield took the bait and Atkins won the interaction, but Machine came away with the win anyway. Drama still won the day. As spectators, it was an exciting and interesting story to follow (in addition to the creep-cam memes that followed) and added some extra spice to an already flaming-hot nationals (should DiG have been in the finals? will team orange redeem themselves in the future? can mixed get any crazier than having the 15-seed in finals?). The question going forward is what role drama will play in the future of the sport. We're 13 years out from Lou's original posts (and the Florida-CUT final that started it all), but drama clearly is still lingering in the air after this nationals.

Thoughts on drama in the future of the sport? International drama you want to share? Role of the lightning rod today?

- I was surprised to learn that Herbert was the only QB to really torch this defense in the air. They held Mayfield and Hurts under 200, and Young picked up garbage yards late to barely get over. All three of those QBs struggled to make quick decisions. 

- Vikings are terrible against short and underneath routes. But if you don't take those and try to hunt big plays their pass rush will hurt you. They blitz **57% of the time** which is nuts.

- With rain looming tomorrow and no Herbert, I think this might be a game where we complain of lack of big throws downfield. But the most successful QBs against this defense have just picked them apart underneath. 

- Also somewhat cautious to call the Vikings terrible. I don't think they are. The QBs that have done really well against them are the elite of the elite processors (Mahomes and Herbert). The other games weren't too notable. 

- Hurts struggled with pressure but routinely rolled out to buy more time. He struggled but got the job done. This might be a game where Fields does the same since he doesn't make decisions as quickly as Herbert and Mahomes.",CHIBears,17,56,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/177tale/how_the_vikings_have_fared_against_opposing_qbs/,football,NA

2023-10-12,1697146929,How are we feeling about our draft class in the early going? (Early draft grades),"One win has immediately got me feeling way better lmao, and I'm feeling good about this draft class right now after the first 5 games.

Darnell Wright: For a rookie OT, this man is crazy impressive. He's already an above average tackle and is showing the skills to be a top 5 RT in this league. Love to see it. So far, 9/10 pick.

Tyrique Stevenson: Rookie CB is maybe the hardest situation to be thrown into in the NFL, sans a rookie QB. Tyrique has had his ups and downs, but the traits have shined. He's a physical specimen who needs to learn when to play physically and when to not initiate contact. Still, I've seen a lot of promise from him. So far, I'd say a 6/10. Lotta upside here.

Gervon Dexter: PFF loves this guy. Me, I feel like what I've seen has been good but I haven't seen that much so far. Hopefully as he earns more reps he shows why we took him so high. Still, he's got those flashes. So far I feel like a 6/10 is fair.

Zacch Pickens: This man is invisible right now. He may be good, he may be awful, but I consider myself to be more informed than most fans and I've seen this guy make like three impactful plays so far, and he's played only a few snaps. So far, I'd say a 3.5/10 is fair, but that's a loose grade. Honestly I lean more towards an incomplete grade so far, but being drafted in the top of the 3rd round brings expectations.

Roschon Johnson: Complete beast. Plays with heart. Downhill runner. Solid pass blocker. 110% effort every play. Running backs may not be as valuable as they used to be, but he's everything you could want and more out of a mid-to-late round RB. So far a 9.5/10.

Tyler Scott: Love the speed he's flashed, but he just hasn't been utilized all too much. With Claypool gone for good (thank god) and EQ potentially being out this week, I expect to see him get more touches. He's been what I've expected so far, so I think a 5/10 is fair.

Noah Sewell: He hasn't been on the field much, but when he has been he's made a few nice plays, especially the forced fumble against Tampa Bay. For what I expected from a 5th round linebacker, I think a 6/10 is fair.

Terell Smith: With our decimated secondary, the man was given an opportunity on Thursday Night and he ran with it. He was all over the ball, solid in coverage, and had a forced fumble that he recovered. At a bare minimum, he looks like an NFL quality cornerback, which already for a 5th rounder is tremendous value. If he can have a few more performances anywhere near Thurday's, he may be more than depth, and that would be a massive, massive hit. For a 5th rounder, he's well outperformed his draft position. 10/10 so far.

Travis Bell: Hasn't recorded an NFL stat. N/A.

Kendall Williamson: Hasn't recorded an NFL stat. N/A.

Overall, Ryan Poles' 2023 class looks incredible so far. Darnell Wright looks like a Blue Chip guy, and there's so much value throughout the draft. I think there's solid odds that the Bears got 4 impact players out of this draft in Wright, Stevenson, Gervon, and RoJo, and that's not even including the guys who've flashed so far but just haven't done it consistently. After the Pace years of whiffing on our high picks, it's nice to see Poles seeming to have reversed that trend in the early going.

2023-10-11,1697066862,Breaking Down JF1 Stats,"A few posts spurred me to do some quick analysis. I say quick because if someone finds I'm off somewhere, feel free to chime in.

Basically, I've seen the swing from JF1 not being our QB to some popularity with posts about not wanting Caleb Williams. I'll precede with saying, I'm hoping JF1 becomes great, but I am not sold on him historically. The rest of the season has to be amazing for me to change my mind. Many of you are probably like me, so here are some numbers from this year and last to backup my feelings with some logic.

**2023**

51.7%, 4 TD, 0 INT, 125.3 RTG, 77.5 QBR

80.0%, 4 TD, 1 INT, 132.7 RTG, 71.1 QBR

50.0%, 1 TD, 1 INT, 58.7 RTG, 17.0 QBR

55.2%, 1 TD, 2 INT, 61.1 RTG, 24.5 QBR

33.3%, 1 TD, 1 INT, 40.8 RTG, 20.3 QBR

65.2%, 1 TD, 0 INT, 92.5 RTG, 55.5 QBR

66.7%, 2 TD 0 INT, 119.5 RTG, 38.6 QBR

60.7%, 3 TD, 0 INT, 106.7 RTG, 96.2 QBR

73.9%, 2 TD, 0 INT, 120 RTG, 76.2 QBR

61.9%, 1 TD, 1 INT, 85.2 RTG, 60.3 QBR

51.9%, 1 TD, 1 INT, 71.5 RTG, 29.6 QBR

71.4%, 1 TD, 0 INT, 118.8 RTG, 80.8 QBR

50.0%, 0 TD, 0 INT, 76.7 RTG, 34.6 QBR

47.1%, 0 TD, 2 INT, 27.7 RTG, 17.3 QBR

63.6%, 0 TD, 1 INT, 43.8 RTG, 6.0 QBR

47.1%, 2 TD, 1 INT, 85.7 RTG, 51.2 QBR

60.1%, 1.4 TD, 0.8 INT, 85.2 RTG, 49.3 QBR

**Standard Deviation**

11.58%, 1.16 TD, 0.68 INT, 28.96 RTG, 27.28 QBR

What these last two games tell us is that these were anomalies based on his historical playing, especially his TD rate. I'm not strong on statistics, but I think that it may show his completion percentage and QBR are widely variable based on the average and the SD. If you are sitting and waiting to see how he plays the rest of the season like I am to feel comfortable moving forward with JF1, here is some backup to it. Unless he proves otherwise, the franchise is likely to move on from him and draft a QB.",CHIBears,49,0,0.32,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/175s8gn/breaking_down_jf1_stats/,football,NA
2023-10-11,1697066551,What player do Bears fans think is going #1?,"Right now, it's going to be Caleb Williams.  

I can tell you who will not be #1.  Marvin Harrison Jr.  

In this history of the NFL Draft a WR has been picked #1 twice. 

 In 1996 and 1984. 

What made these drafts different from the others is the lack of quarterbacks.  In neither draft was a QB taken in the first round   

That is not going to happen this year.  

In the Super Bowl era, the 1st overall pick is always one of four positions.  Defensive End, Tackle, Quarterback or Running Back.  

The two WRs to go #1 would should surprise you. 

1996 - Keyshawn Johnson
1984 - Irving Fryar

Neither lived up to expectations.  

Yes, MHJ is an incredible talent, but so was:

Calvin Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, and Andre Johnson.  None them went one.  

So, unless a Bruce Smith or Orlando Pace is hiding somewhere in college football, the Bears are trading down from #1.

2023-10-11,1697064149,"There is no such a thing as a ""can't miss"" draft pick","It's getting really frustrating to hear people talk as if it's a fact that there are ""can't miss"" franchise quarterbacks.  The first question is: Can't miss what? Can't miss top 10 or top 5?  I think people mean ""top 5"" but that makes me even more skeptical.

**Here's the reality:** There is no such thing as a can't miss.

**Basic supporting evidence:**

* Since 2007 there have been 12 quarterbacks taken with the #1 overall (see list below)
* Excluding Trevor Lawrence and Bryce Young, because they're still young in their careers, we have 10 quarterbacks.
* Out of the 10 QBs pre-2020, how many of them would you consider to be top 5 at anypoint in their career?  I estimate 5 of the 10 (see below - I even counted Goff as top 5 though that's debatable)
* Everyone of these teams banked on these guys as turning around their franchise and they just didn't

**Main point:** If you think Justin Fields is a top 10 QB by the end of this year you keep him and roll with him.  Why? History tells you Caleb Williams has a higher chance of not being a top 5 QB then you believe.  If you already have a guy who is proving it, you stick with him and use your high draft picks to build around him.

**Footnote:** I do not yet believe Fields has proven himself to be a top 10 QB.  That's what the remainder of this season is for.  To me, he has to show consistently that he's the QB of the last two games and not the first three.  I'm hoping he does.

2023-10-11,1697052041,Justin Fields is better than Caleb Williams (and a lot of NFL QBs),"USC Alum and Bears fan here. I'm tired of/mildly infuriated by the vocal minority of my fellow Bears fans wanting to move on from our guy just as he's becoming who we hoped he'd be. Moreover, we're wanting to move on to an inferior player.

I've watched both QBs a lot. I think Justin is better, straight up, and has more potential, straight up. All of the Caleb Williams takes are going to end up looking very, very foolish, very, very soon. 

First of all, let's look at the stats. Here are three QBs in Lincoln Riley's offensive system

Player 1
285 comp	404 att	70.5	comp %  4627 yds	43 TDs	6 INTs	198.9 RTG

Player 2
260 comp	377 att	69.0	comp % 4361 YDs 42	TDs  7 INTs	199.2 RTG

Player 3
333 comp	500	att   66.6 comp % 4537 YD    42	TDs   5 INTs	168.5

Pretty similar stats right?  The system is as QB friendly as it gets. Player 1 is Baker Mayfield. Player 2 is Kyler Murray. Player 3 (the guy with the worst completion %) is Caleb. Both of those other two guys were number one overall picks. Would you want either of them over Justin?

Secondly, let's look at tendencies you see on tape/film. Caleb plays at one of the premier college programs in the country. His program has more talent at every position than any other opponent he is likely to play. His offensive line and WRs are superior to the DL and secondaries he is playing against. Perhaps as a result, Caleb holds onto the ball for a LONG LONG time. He  scrambles away from less talented athletes than him to extend plays, and waits for his more talented receivers to win downfield. Even still, he throws a lot of contested balls.  He very rarely throws ""on time"" or ""with anticipation,"" things Justin is starting to do a lot of.  He's not as fast as Justin is (4.65 vs. 4.4), and will have a harder time getting away from NFL DEs than Justin does. He's looking for home run balls (sound familiar)? AND, imo, has a significantly WORSE deep ball than Justin does. You almost never see Caleb throw those perfectly placed deep balls to his  guy in one on one coverage 40 yards downfield like Justin does (he even did it last year with EQ and Pettis as his number 2 and 3 guys). 

Caleb's worst games are against his highest ranked competition. He has not played a ranked team yet this year. The best opponent he played last year was Utah (11). Later this year, they'll be playing Notre Dame (this weekend), Oregon, and Washington. I think he'll look human, even though they all have less talent than USC does.  In the Utah game, he had Jordan Addison (currently tearing up the NFL) as his # 1 receiver. Take a look at how he performed against them here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLE6-Q2-4dc

Do you see a single play Justin wouldn't make or make better? I think we may forget how unbelievable Justin was as a prospect. For an apples to apples comparison, let's take a look at how Justin performed against a Michigan team (finished 18) with Aidan Hutchison breathing down his neck all game:

Pretty special shit, right? In both games, he comes back from what look like brutal injuries to absolutely dominate a team that, on paper, has comparable talent. Caleb Williams hasn't put anything on tape anywhere close to either of these two games.

Now let's take a look at what's happened so far in Justin's NFL career. I think we all agree that few, if any, young quarterbacks have had to deal with a worse situation in terms of coaching and talent as Justin has. And yet, even in those adverse circumstances, he has done things no QB in the NFL has ever done. Last year, he put up 2 of the top 10 single game rushing performances by a QB ever (including the best ever). The only reason he didn't break the single season record  for QB rush yards is because they shut him down at the end of the season.  He often got the absolute shit beat out of him trying to win for our team. I would argue he ran so often because he trusted himself more than he trusted the other guys on the team (for good reason, even Mooney dropped big plays last year). The fact that he looks like he does now, in spite of what the Bears organization (and frankly, Bears fans) have put him through, is truly remarkable.

Now, he has a decent O line and some talent on the perimeter. And a coordinator is designing our gameplans around his strengths. Not coincidentally, you're starting to see him do all of the things we have wanted him to do since he got here. If you watch those college games, he looks a hell of a lot like that guy we saw at Ohio State. He is dominating. He is going to continue to dominate.  If you don't believe me, ask Justin Jefferson:

This is it. This is the player we've been waiting for at QB. He is making the year three leap that we have been talking about and hoping for for two years, and now, because of a bad start due to horrible gameplanning and OL play, we're talking about replacing him with a guy who, IMO, has proven less and looks worse.

I get it guys, we haven't seen good quarterbacking in this town for most of our lifetimes. As a result, some of us wouldn't know it if it hit us in the face. But over the past two games, Justin has put up passing numbers no Bears QB has ever put up. Over the past two years, Justin has done things no QB in the NFL has ever done. Expect it to continue. Frankly, expect it to improve--if we've learned anything about this kid over the last two years, it's that he works hard and continues to get better. Enjoy the ride, get behind our guy, and stop looking elsewhere for the answer.",CHIBears,396,584,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/175meev/justin_fields_is_better_than_caleb_williams_and_a/,football,NA

2023-10-11,1697053476,The Art of Flow State Quarterbacking,"Listened to this clip earlier and found it very interesting. It was a refreshing perspective on Justin's QB play and the overall importance of the mental aspect in highly-competitive environments. I think we often get so lost in the details of the game  that we forget how crucial things like confidence, self-belief and mental clarity can be. 

One clip that stood out to me was the idea of whiteboard IQ vs. on-field IQ. There are many QBs that are absolutely extraordinary in practice or in meetings, but ultimately fail to translate it into their game. With Justin, I have always been of the opinion that he does see the fields, but he just lacks the confidence/trust to make the play when it's there. I never really thought the issue was he couldn't comprehend what he saw, he just never acted upon what he saw in a timely manner. 

The biggest takeaway that I got from this video was the interesting look into flow state or in the zone for a sports player. If you aren't aware of the term, it is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when an individual's mind and body connect as one. You are completely immersed in the moment, free from all external distraction or internal doubt that may have gotten to you in the past. Your senses and awareness are heightened, and become synchronized with the focus of completing the task in front of you. Although there are varying levels of this phenomenon and much of the neurological/psychological research done on the topic is relatively new, what we do know is individuals who regularly enter this zone are the ones who experience the most success in whatever field they operate within. 

Now I know there's going to be people out there who read this and think I'm some sort of delusional monk, but if you have played sports at ANY level, I think you know what it feels like to enter this mindset. You aren't thinking, you are only doing. Your hard work and training surface in a way that allows you to know exactly what must be done to win and how it must be done. There is no self doubt or hesitation in your decision making.

Here's a link on the topic if you want to learn more: [https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-flow-2794768]

So what does all this have to do with Justin? Well, I believe the past two weeks are games in which he's starting to reach that flow state. He's not hesitant mentally or gun shy. He's starting to trust those around him to make plays. He is combining his high level skillset with confidence and mental aptitude. The question now will be, how often can he reside in that mindset? Can he do it consistently? When you watch a guy like Mahomes or Josh Allen, they are the ultimate example of mental strength. They do things that seem impossible, yet make it look so easy. What makes them great is they know how to enter their flow state consistently, and can do it even in extremely high pressure/clutch scenarios.",CHIBears,13,21,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/175mylc/the_art_of_flow_state_quarterbacking/,football,NA

And the defense played better, they were more fired up because the offense wsas sustaining drives and actually scoring and keeping the team in games.  That made the defense both more rested  and more motivated.

It just seemed like the offense totally changed. It's like the offensive coaching staff said, ""Screw it, we might as well go down swinging."" Or actually got a clue, they should have been doing that all year long.

2023-10-18,1697649298,Fields may be a good QB but he won't succeed here,"Wanted to share this long tweet by Robert Schmitz which was insightful and depressing about the Bears future at the same time. It's clear they need to completely clean house and it's not just a QB change away. 

""Watching the #Bears tape is a mess -- nothing meshes together. What Getsy wants to do isn't what Fields wants to do, and the Bears can't do what Fields wants to do well against blitzing teams.

You can tell Getsy's answers to Minnesota's blitzes were quick throws out wide, but Fields couldn't execute some of them and Whitehair's snaps ruined others.

Then, the Bears pivoted towards more max protect. Fields looked more comfortable, but the OL couldn't ID blitzes properly and gave away bad matchups (like Foreman on Hunter/Foreman on a blitzer with runway) leading to more pressure, no throws downfield, and the QB taking more hits.

Some of the above is still on Getsy, because plenty of routes too WAY too long to resolve against the blitz -- Mooney jukes the air in the red zone, Trent Taylor runs the longest whip route in existence, etc. Of course, neither is open in time to beat the pressure (and one leads to the INT).

It's easy to make this out to be a QB-only problem, but it's the same problem we've seen all season -- when the Bears' initial plan doesn't work, Getsy and Fields' philosophical disagreements result in awful football that can't even compete with opposing defenses.

Of course, this magnifies every mistake anyone on the OL makes -- if CHI doesn't get the exact look they want and perfect protection up front, the play might as well be over. It doesn't feel like there's much chemistry between the QB and his outlets when things go haywire.

But if all the above wasn't bad enough, sometimes the Bears do get the exact look they want with perfect protection up front, like the play shown below:

The Vikings threaten to bring 8 while the Bears protect with 7, but they drop 4 rushers out and get into a Cover 2/Tampa 2 look. Darnell Mooney is wide open, and you could argue Moore is too -- Fields stares right at Mooney, so his eyes are in the right place.

He doesn't throw it. He didn't in the 3rd game of the preseason against a similar look, likely because of the INT he threw trying the same throw against Houston in 2022. But unfortunately, this means that even when the Bears get that 'exact look they want with perfect protection up front' they aren't always guaranteed to succeed. Bummer. 

The play results in a failure to convert on 3rd down, an unnecessary hit, and the effective end of the game.

This Bears offense is sick, and it's not one player away -- it's great that 'it works when it works', but when it rains it pours and you can't win games that way long-term.

In my opinion, that falls on Getsy. The OC has to change before the 2024 season or else no QB, OL, or WR changes will fix all the problems we see on the 'bad Sundays'. It starts with coaching, and the coaching is bad bad.

Unfortunately for Fields, I don't know if this gives him a path to QBing the Bears in 2024 -- if you're changing OCs (or HCs, I hope) the new coach would have to commit to Fields long-term coming off a 3rd straight season where Fields missed time for injury and turned in spotty performances.

A new coach could probably get JF looking better in a new offense, but by passing on Caleb Williams or Drake Maye you pit Fields against those rookies' mythos and demand instantaneous success from Fields in 2024. It's too toxic an environment, I have little doubt they'll opt for a clean split barring an incredible Fields run that starts very soon and doesn't end.

This ended up being a long ramble-post, but it's such a bummer watching QB &amp; OC butt heads like this nearly every week where things go awry. Maybe Bagent will give us something new to watch (at the very least, it should be closer to 'Getsy's Vision') but as a UDFA rookie he presents his own limitations that are worth their own post.""",CHIBears,231,107,0.72,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17avz6s/fields_may_be_a_good_qb_but_he_wont_succeed_here/,football,NA

I've paused the clip just as Moore begins to turn around.

First of all, Blazingame apparently isn't supposed to be there at the bottom. He's supposed to go and clear out that cornerback. Nevertheless, there's no clear passing lane open to hit him.

So why doesn't Justin hit this throw? Could it be that there's a 300lb Nate Davis being pushed into his passing lane? Could it also be that he's about 0.1 seconds away from getting absolutely blown up by an edge rusher?

I'm sick of hearing people talk about how he should have let go of the ball. LOOK AT THE STATE OF THAT PASS PRO!  HOW IN THE HOLY F\*\*K CAN ANYONE WORK BEHIND THAT?? Even JTO says that line needs to slide left. Even if he adjusts and floats the ball gently over Nate Davis, Moore is getting absolutely clattered by that LB a half-second later.

2023-10-18,1697597801,Something I've noticed about the Nagy Era and now the Eberflus Era and Lovie Smith Era,"When Matt Nagy was hired the Bears already had Vic Fangio in place as DC with his full staff. The staff that Vic brought with him had mostly been with him for years. They were his guys and they new how to work together. Vic's decades of experience really had him more as ""Head Coach of Defense"" than DC.

Nagy on the other hand immediately assembled a Frankenstein-esque Offensive Coaching Staff. Most guys he never worked with before. There was no familiarity, no ""system"" they all had multiple seasons working on together and honing.

As a result, the Bears defenses were the strong part of the team, and the offenses never gained traction or developed any consistency.

Fast forward to the current regime and pretty much the same is happening. The Offense under Getsy is a collection of random coaches who don't have much experience working together, no familiarity, no unified system they've had multiple years honing as a coaching staff.

Eberflus and his Defensive staff are a different story. A lot of them have coached with Eberflus in the past but they've never had good results. Their Defenses have been mediocre at best in Indianapolis, and that is carrying over to the Bears.

Go back in time to the Lovie Smith Era and it's more of the same. Lovie's Defensive Coaching Staffs were a collection of ""Lovie's Guys"" that were familiar with one another and had been honing a system together for multiple years. His offenses were the opposite...random OC's who patch worked together staffs with no consistency or unified vision.

Whomever the next coaches are I don't care if it's a ""Defensive Guru"" or ""Offensive Expert"". I want both sides of the ball to have staffs that have worked together before, have familiarity, a unified system and vision that they've been honing for multiple seasons. And more than anything the ability to develop the talent on the roster, and install systems that fit their personnel.

Just another layer of dysfunction that has permeated the Bears organization for decades. Wake me up when the nightmare is over.",CHIBears,43,58,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17agfcf/something_ive_noticed_about_the_nagy_era_and_now/,football,NA

2023-10-18,1697589575,Way-Too-Early 2024 Bears Mock Offseason,"Greetings fellow depressed Bears fans!

It's at times like these during the season that it's easy to wallow in the negativity and failure of our Chicago Bears. But in order to keep us sane during these trying times, we can look forward to our hopefully bright future and what our team could look like after this season. So, without further ado, I present my Way-Too-Early In-depth Mock Offseason for 2024.

*Disclaimer: I am not a professional scout or anything near it. So while i do put a lot of research into these, some of my research may be wrong. Some of my estimates may be off. Please don't flame me in the comments.*

***Mock Offseason 2024***

**2024 Cap Space: $95,832,832 (Per Spotrac)**

***Cuts and Trades***

**Cut IOL Cody Whitehair - $9.15M ($4.1M Dead Cap)**  
**Trade QB Justin Fields - $3.23M ($2.7M Dead Cap)**

**Cap Space: $108,212,832**

***Re-signings/Extensions***

**Re-sign WR Darnell Mooney to 3-year, $36 million deal ($12M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Re-sign CB Jaylon Johnson to 3-year, $28.5 million deal ($9.5M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Re-sign K Cairo Santos to 3-year, $9 million deal ($3M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Re-sign DT Andrew Billings to 2-year, $8 million deal ($4M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Re-sign LS Patrick Scales to 1-year, $1.8 million deal**

Mooney and Johnson are the clear highlights here. Neither will or should demand bank-breaking contracts and both have been reliable at their positions for as long as they've been on the team. I think it's a no-brainer to extend them at a reasonable price. Cairo Santos has been a gem, and one of the most accurate kickers in the league. I don't see why they would try to replace him and risk going through kicker troubles again. Billings has been playing lights out after the Bears signed him to be a run stuffer, but he's proven valuable against the pass as well and has been the clear best player on the defensive front.

**Remaining Cap Space: $77,912,832**

***Free Agency Signings***

**Sign WAS DE Montez Sweat to 4-year, $64 million deal ($16M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Sign TEN DT Teair Tart to 2-year, $10 million deal ($5M cap hit in 2024)**

Defensive line help! Sweat is the major signing of this mock offseason and could realistically test free agency if the Commanders choose to extend Chase Young over him. Tart is a very underrated player and should solidify the interior of the line with Billings and Dexter.

**Sign TEN WR Nick Westbrook-Ikhine to 1-year, $4 million deal**  
**Sign TEN IOL Corey Levin to 2-year, $6 million deal ($3M cap hit in 2024)**  
**Sign SEA QB Drew Lock to 1-year, $3 million deal**  
**Sign CIN TE Irv Smith Jr. to 1-year, $1.8 million deal**

All of these are major depth signings. After years of a revolving doors at center, Levin ensures that the Bears have solid depth at the position and if all goes according to plan, he wouldn't even be the starter. Westbrook-Ikhine has played well on a bad Titans passing offense, and brings size and blocking skills to the table. Drew Lock is a solid backup and has played well in limited action with the Seahawks. Finally, Irv Smith Jr. would man the TE2 spot. He was a 2nd round draft pick in 2019 and has the tools to be an impact player but hasn't put it together yet. He's worth a flier on a cheap deal with Kmet already in place.

**Sign MIN TE Johnny Mundt to 1-year, $1.2 million deal**  
**Sign LB Troy Reeder to 1-year, $965,000 deal**

Inexpensive, bottom of the roster depth signings.

**Remaining Cap Space: $42,947,832**

This number will be a lot lower in reality due to rookie contracts, practice squad contracts, and training camp bodies that I didn't account for here.

***Mock Draft***

**Trade Pick 1 to NE for Pick 3, Pick 35, and a 2025 1st Round Pick**  
**Trade QB Justin Fields to ATL for Pick 44 and a 2025 5th Round Pick**  
**Trade Pick 130 to PHI for Pick 158 and Pick 185**

**Round 1, Pick 2 - WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Ohio State)**

The harder question to answer about Harrison Jr. is what does he not have? As a receiver prospect, he has elite size, speed, hands, body control, production, and route-running ability. The only slight knock on his game is he's not great at generating yards after the catch, but the Bears already have one of the best YAC receivers in the league in DJ Moore. Marvin Harrison Jr. is drawing comparisons to Calvin Johnson coming out of college, and is truly a generational wide receiver prospect. He instantly makes the Bears WR group a top-5 unit.

**Round 1, Pick 3 (Via NE) - QB Drake Maye (North Carolina)**

Caleb Williams is, so far, the consensus #1 QB and 2024 prospect overall. But in my (probably unpopular) opinion, Maye is just as good as, if not better than Williams as a prospect and if the Bears can add some picks while still grabbing one of the top 2 QBs, they should absolutely do this. Maye is built like the prototypical QB: 6-5, 230 pounds with a strong and accurate arm that can throw darts to any level of the field. He also adds dual threat potential as a tough runner for his size and has the improvisational ability to create when the play breaks down like on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6CU6EkW7WY) insane left-handed touchdown pass. Overall, Maye is an elite QB prospect that reminds me of Justin Herbert coming out of college.

**Round 2, Pick 34 - OT Jordan Morgan (Arizona)**

While Braxton Jones has played impressively at left tackle given his draft pedigree, he has shown that the Bears need to look elsewhere for stability on the offensive line. Jordan Morgan likely would have been a high round pick this past April had he not suffered a torn ACL in late November of 2022. Assuming he's back to full health, Morgan absolutely has the elite traits to be a franchise left tackle. A 320-pound man should not be able to move like he does. He couples his surprising mobility with good power and anchor.

**Round 2, Pick 35 (Via NE) - DE Bralen Trice (Washington)**

We finally turn to the defensive line, which has been the Bears' biggest weakness so far in the 2023 season. Trice was super productive in a breakout 2022, with a whopping 70 pressures which was the most in all of college football. He is another prospect who is an incredible athlete for his size, at 6-4 and 270 pounds. He's a great pass rusher and while he does need to improve in run defense, Trice is easily a day one starter on the depleted defensive line.

**Round 2, Pick 44 (Via ATL) - IOL Sedrick Van Pran (Georgia)**

Van Pran is a prospect that I've liked for a while and with the Bears' struggles at center he's a perfect fit here. Van Pran has been the starter for both of Georgia's national championship seasons and as such has played against great competition, not to mention the vaunted Georgia defensive front in practice every week. Van Pran is an all-around solid prospect with good size, mobility, and power while being one of the most experienced centers in the class.

**Round 3, Pick 70 - DT Tyleik Williams (Ohio State)**

The Bears continue to load up in the trenches with a high-upside DT in Tyleik Williams. Williams has flashed great upside but has played limited snaps in his time at Ohio State. Williams does have the tools to be a dominant interior defensive lineman with the requisite power, length, size and burst to win up the middle.

**Round 4, Pick 105 - IOL Zak Zinter (Michigan)**

Hope for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the advice the Bears should follow with Teven Jenkins and the right guard spot. Obviously one hopes that Jenkins can stay healthy and continue to be the dominant lineman he has been, but so far he hasn't proven capable of starting a full 17-game season, so it would be wise to have a solid backup behind him. Zinter isn't an elite athlete, but he possesses great size, physicality, intelligence, and he plays with a mauling attitude. He's an ideal next man up on the interior line.

**Round 5, Pick 135 - S Hudson Clark (Arkansas)**

Eddie Jackson is getting older and hasn't been able to recapture his 2018 magic despite a promising start to 2022 due to inconsistent play and injuries. Clark, like Jackson, is a rangy ballhawking safety with a knack for creating turnovers. He would be the de-facto Jackon backup with the potential to replace him once Jackson's contract expires.

**Round 5, Pick 158 (Via PHI) - WR Jayden Thomas (Notre Dame)**

Reliability. That's what Jayden Thomas brings to the Bears' receiver corps. Thomas is a big, physical slot receiver who has great hands and runs crisp routes. He can develop into a QB-friendly safety valve and an important depth piece with added value on special teams.

**Round 6, Pick 185 (Via PHI) - CB Darian Chestnut (LSU)**

With how decimated the Bears' secondary has been, it's not hard to see why they need to bring in more depth at corner. Darian Duce Chestnut not only has an awesome name but would be important depth and a special teams player.

Of course there are some variables at play here such as how soon he returns from injury and how he performs down the stretch. Let's assume he misses 3 games and then returns and plays with similar results as he has to the this point in his career. Mostly bad or average games sprinkled with some big games and flashes of big upside.

He'll have 1 year of control left. Similar trades in recent memory are Trey Lance to the Cowboys for a 4th and Jimmy G to the 49ers for a 2nd.

2023-10-17,1697563813,Schmitz take on Bears Vikings Film,"Watching the #Bears tape is a mess -- nothing meshes together. What Getsy wants to do isn't what Fields wants to do, and the Bears can't do what Fields wants to do well against blitzing teams.

You can tell Getsy's answers to Minnesota's blitzes were quick throws out wide, but Fields couldn't execute some of them and Whitehair's snaps ruined others.

Then, the Bears pivoted towards more max protect. Fields looked more comfortable, but the OL couldn't ID blitzes properly and gave away bad matchups (like Foreman on Hunter/Foreman on a blitzer with runway) leading to more pressure, no throws downfield, and the QB taking more hits.

Some of the above is still on Getsy, because plenty of routes too WAY too long to resolve against the blitz -- Mooney jukes the air in the red zone, Trent Taylor runs the longest whip route in existence, etc. Of course, neither is open in time to beat the pressure (and one leads to the INT).

It's easy to make this out to be a QB-only problem, but it's the same problem we've seen all season -- when the Bears' initial plan doesn't work, Getsy and Fields' philosophical disagreements result in awful football that can't even compete with opposing defenses.

Of course, this magnifies every mistake anyone on the OL makes -- if CHI doesn't get the exact look they want and perfect protection up front, the play might as well be over. It doesn't feel like there's much chemistry between the QB and his outlets when things go haywire.

But if all the above wasn't bad enough, sometimes the Bears do get the exact look they want with perfect protection up front, like the play shown below:

The Vikings threaten to bring 8 while the Bears protect with 7, but they drop 4 rushers out and get into a Cover 2/Tampa 2 look. Darnell Mooney is wide open, and you could argue Moore is too -- Fields stares right at Mooney, so his eyes are in the right place.

He doesn't throw it. He didn't in the 3rd game of the preseason against a similar look, likely because of the INT he threw trying the same throw against Houston in 2022. But unfortunately, this means that even when the Bears get that 'exact look they want with perfect protection up front' they aren't always guaranteed to succeed. Bummer. 

The play results in a failure to convert on 3rd down, an unnecessary hit, and the effective end of the game.

This Bears offense is sick, and it's not one player away -- it's great that 'it works when it works', but when it rains it pours and you can't win games that way long-term.

In my opinion, that falls on Getsy. The OC has to change before the 2024 season or else no QB, OL, or WR changes will fix all the problems we see on the 'bad Sundays'. It starts with coaching, and the coaching is bad bad.

Unfortunately for Fields, I don't know if this gives him a path to QBing the Bears in 2024 -- if you're changing OCs (or HCs, I hope) the new coach would have to commit to Fields long-term coming off a 3rd straight season where Fields missed time for injury and turned in spotty performances.

A new coach could probably get JF looking better in a new offense, but by passing on Caleb Williams or Drake Maye you pit Fields against those rookies' mythos and demand instantaneous success from Fields in 2024. It's too toxic an environment, I have little doubt they'll opt for a clean split barring an incredible Fields run that starts very soon and doesn't end.

This ended up being a long ramble-post, but it's such a bummer watching QB &amp; OC butt heads like this nearly every week where things go awry. Maybe Bagent will give us something new to watch (at the very least, it should be closer to 'Getsy's Vision') but as a UDFA rookie he presents his own limitations that are worth their own post.

On to next week (and I'll see you tonight for All-22uesday)

2023-10-17,1697531171,Has anyone seen JTO's breakdown of week 6 yet?,"I'm halfway through watching it now and it's literally a case of terrible pass pro and f\*\*\*ing abysmal snaps every single time, with a good pinch of bad play calling. There are literally two plays where JT says Justin should have got the ball out. One is a check down to Kmet but Fields runs it anyway and gets a decent gain but not enough for 1st down. Checking to Kmet here wouldn't have resulted in a 1st down wither. The second one is the play where he gets injured - regardless of what you all say, Moore was not open but Mooney was waaaaay open for a deep ball and a TD. Also, both Fields and Bagents' fumbles were caused by the running back being schemed to block a defensive end. Let me say that again; the RUNNING BACK...yes, the 5ft 11, 210lb player lined up next to the QB... was schemed BOTH TIMES...to block a 6ft 4, 280lb defensive end. So not only did it result in a turnover the first time, Getsy called the f\*\*\*ing thing again and the exact same thing happened!

""That snap is literally sabotaging the game!""

So, we are in an interesting spot. Caleb looked like trash, Fields looked like trash and then got hurt, and Bagent looked like trash but in a different way so it confused some of us. Emphasis on ""looked like"".

So where does that put everyone? 

As of right now, I'm still on the JF1 boat, but if Bagent comes out Sunday and looks halfway decent, I'll admit my wrongs and shift my support toward TB17. I could, and would, defend Justin all day and can point fingers at scheming and play calling, or at blocking or lack there of. But after a week of 1st team prep, if Bagent has a 250+ yard game, then I think the answer is pretty obvious. Especially if it's a win. It's a big IF. Then I still don't know if we draft Caleb or not, because we don't even have someone who can snap a ball properly. He's lauded as generational talent, but so was T Law and Young.

We need help and This provides us more pressure on opposing QBs

2023-10-16,1697474133,"Williams, Maye, or Penix Jr.","I am a Fields stan, but if this injury sidelines him for an extended period of time, sadly, his time in Chicago is more likely than not, over.     
    
That being said, there is a non-zero chance we end up with 2 top-5 picks in the upcoming draft, which means we may get our pick of the litter for a new QB.     
    
I know Williams was and is still the consensus #1 pick for everyone including experts, GMs, armchair GMs, etc. But let's pump the brakes for a minute and think about this.     
    
Williams is Fields 2.0. Can use his mobility to bail him out, has a great arm, and is a special athlete. However, he is smaller than Fields, and holds onto the ball a long time going for a home run more often than not. Additionally, you look at the teams he has faced this year, and those defenses would lose by 70+ to the worst NFL team. He faced a good defense in ND and didn't look great.      
    
Now if we look at Maye, he is more of a prototypical pocket passer, tall, strong, he LOOKS the part of a franchise QB for sure. He has also faced better defenses than Williams and is undefeated.     
    
Then we have Penix Jr, who could be a wildcard. I admittedly probably wouldn't take him above the other two, but don't be surprised if he balls out in the pros for whoever gets him. He look's electric.     
    
All I am saying is that the Williams is not and should not be our only focus at QB, I think Maye translates as a better pro and would be the much safer, higher floor type of player, reminds me of Justin Herbert.     
    
The caveat to that is out OL as it stands now cannot accommodate a pure pocket passer, so major upgrades will need to be made to ensure that QB doesn't get murdered.     
    
My ideal scenario, albeit unlikely, is we end up with Maye and MHJ. If we don't get him then the top OL on the board. I know the DL sucks but this isn't the draft for that position.",CHIBears,156,23,0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/179a943/williams_maye_or_penix_jr/,football,NA

2023-10-16,1697468600,The coaching sucks,"Ok, this may sound like more complaining and honestly, what I am about to say is nothing new but I still feel like it needs to be said.

As a disclaimer, from jump street I have been a JF1 supporter and honestly still am. His struggles are not all his fault. It is primarily the coaching or lack thereof that is the biggest issue.

Let's take a walk down the painful memory lane. Nagy refused to scheme around his skill set and sent him out to be a lamb to slaughter, multiple times (looking at the Cleveland game as a perfect example).

Getsey has shown time and time again that he is clueless to his personnel and Eberflus is in way over his head. When asked about why we didn't target DJ, more after his monster game, his response? ""We need to look into it."" How is that an acceptable response for a head coach? We have an amazing receiver and are not using him? That in and of itself should be a fireable offense.

In my mind, the jury is still out on Poles. Sure he made some dumb decisions (Claypool, Velus, not using the money last year to sure up the trenches) but he has done some good too (DJ, multiple draft picks for next year, extending Kmet)

I get the sentiment that we need to move on, get Caleb or whomever as the next big thing in football but realistically, if we keep getting these window licking coaches who can't game plan to save their life, we could realistically have the messiah of QB's at our disposal and it would be for naught.

Where do we go from here? Simple. Fire the lot of them and do it now. Set the statement that sub par performance will not be tolerated, limp through the rest of the season and actually build a team that can compete in the National Football League next year.

Hasn't even reached two years for his tenure. Do I think the coaching staff should be cleaned up? Yes absolutely. But give Ryan Poles a little more wiggle room here guys. Rebuilds take on average three years to complete give or take. Some less, some more. It all depends on how big the mess is a new GM is inheriting at the time. But to go for Poles' head right now shouldn't be the focus. The coaching staff needs cleaning up. Fields obviously needs more help still reading defenses as you could see with the wide open targets going unnoticed. O-line is still a mess and our center keeps muffing snaps. There's still work to be done. We live in this instant gratification society and unfortunately it won't work that way with how bad our team was before Poles came in. Remember, the reason we are possibly going to have TWO TOP 5 FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICKS is because of Poles. I think that he wasn't planning on it going that way and at least snagging one top 5 draft pick, but it's turning out that way. I think strict evaluation on Poles will be necessary in the following year, but ease up a bit on him fellas. Geez la weez

2023-10-22,1697990426,The Bagent Effect? The Bagentstein Bears?,"After the game last Sunday, if you asked me to describe our backup QB, I would have said he got the ball out quick and had a decent performance considering the circumstances, but ultimately Tyler Bagent was undersized at only like 5'11 with a noodle arm which is concerning.

2 days ago my reality was upended and I was shook to my core when I found out he was listed as 6'3, his name is Tyson, and he registered the 3rd strongest arm at the combine, including an arm stronger than CJ Stroud. (Dude looks like he's 4 inches shorter than Justin Fields out there and Fields is 6'3 himself)

I'm sure some of you are aware, but there is a phenomenon called the [Mandela Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect), where lots of people believed one thing happened in the past, and lots of other people believe something else happened. For example, some people thought Nelson Mandela died in the 1980s even though he died in 2013, and a lot of people think the children's book, Berenstain Bears, was definitely actually spelled ""Berenstein"". People have suggested this could be due to a glitch in the multiverse where differing timelines become entangled.

So today is not just a big day for Bears fans to see how our rookie backup can perform in his first start, it's also a huge day for humanity. It will determine what timeline and universe we actually live in. Will he be 6'3? Will he be 5'11? Maybe he all the sudden becomes 5'6, or possibly even 6'7. Will his name remain Tyson? Or could it switch back to Tyler, maybe even become Tyrone Bagent? And will he have a cannon or a noodle?

I don't know, but we must consider the space time continuum/multiverse implications of today's game and what it means for science, reality, and life in general.

TLDR; Tyson Bagent may be the key to uncovering the secrets of the universe

I was yelling about this at the time but I figured the regime had a plan afterwards.

Meanwhile, the plan was to have Whitehair as the starting center.

2023-10-21,1697929267,Nostradamus& My take on what's going to happen Tomorrow and through the Panthers Game.,"Bagent throws for 270 yards and 2 TD's ( 1 fumble &amp; 1 INT) against the raiders and Da bears win 27 to 24.

After the game this entire sub is freaking out and proclaims that Bagent is the second coming of Tom Brady. Verbal wars between Field Supporters &amp; Bear fans breakout and we get to read about it until the following Sunday when the bears play the chargers.

Bears lose to the chargers on Sunday night, however Bagent plays well enough to win. Additionally, Eberflus makes several mistakes Sunday night (similar to Denver game) and America gets to see him as the joke that he is.

Fields proves he is a tough SOB and comes back to play the following week, however, we lose the game. Fields has a decent game and limits turnovers but does not play well enough to win the game against NO.

A week of reddit arguments ensue and we are all fighting about who we think is the better QB (Fields or Bagent).

All of a sudden we are playing the Panthers who are still winless. Fields comes out hot and decides to say f**k it, and tries to be the QB he was last year and takes a couple long runs to the house. However, the defense can't keep the lead and the bears end up loosing and giving the panthers their first win.",CHIBears,21,0,0.47,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17dezm7/nostradamus_my_take_on_whats_going_to_happen/,football,NA

Raiders game:

\-The offensive line gives up 4 sacks to a DE nobody has ever heard of

\-at least 1 drive strictly consisting of screens or inside zone runs

\-Sometime in the game we see Jaquan Brisker laying lifeless on the ground only to get back up and smoke a WR

\-Bagent ends up throwing for 17/24 2 TDs 1 INT, all throws being hospital passes to DJ Moore

\-The defense gives up the most random 40 yard catch ever and we lose by a game ending FG 20-17

\-Stale rant videos from your favorite bears content creators

&amp;#x200B;

Chargers week:

\-Tyson Bagent gets hyped up in the media for no stable reason

\-Another dick numbing press conference by Ebernoose

\-Mock draft videos slowly take over

\-Tim Jenkins, Robert Schmitz, and JT O' Sullivan breakdowns all over twitter

\-Justin Fields is ""miraculously"" cleared to return and will start over Bagent

\-The sub's continuous posts about MHJ, Williams, or Maye

\-A weird injury report

&amp;#x200B;

Chargers game:

\- Everybody in the nation saying this is the Khalil Mack revenge game

\-Herbert throws for 400

\-at least 1 drive strictly consisting of screens or inside zone runs

\-Fields plays relatively bad, officially starting the 2nd civil war in the subreddit (Team Bagent vs Team Fields)

\-DJ Moore gets 2 targets and another nasty shot to his back but smiles anyways

\-The defense is hot and cold

\-Cairos hits a useless 50 yarder

\-Fields throws a game losing interception that surprises nobody, ending a 33-13 booty blasting

\-Stale rant videos from your favorite bears content creators

&amp;#x200B;

The bears are 1-7 and the season is officially over. The rest of the season on the subreddit will strictly be memes, posts about the 2024 draft, and rants. (All warranted). Comment if there's anything I missed

2023-10-21,1697856264,Bears cannot make the same mistake the panthers made picking Bryce over Stroud,"I want to start off by saying that I think caleb is an intriguing  prospect that could eventually end up working out, but I think maye is a tier above him.

Caleb gets a lot of compliments for having that ""magic"". Basically he's good at scrambling and making something out of nothing. However thats not something that translates easily in the nfl. You know what does? Throwing with anticipation. Maye is an  elite prospect for this. The ball is never late. Its every throw too. Every throw whether its the first second or third option, every throw always has pinpoint timing. Not only does he go through his progressions,  he throws the ball on time, every time. Even incompletions are on time lol. He's legitimately  throwing receivers open, not just managing a game but actually changing it. The size to stand in the pocket and see the entire field instead of having to drop back extra steps like bryce, the effortless arm talent not only to hit the receiver but to give the db 0 chance of making a play, maye projects a lot better at this than bryce and I think he has a clear advantage over caleb as well.

Thats not to say bryce and caleb can't throw with anticipation, bryce was actually very good with anticipation throws in college, however he can't replicate that in the nfl because he's physically limited. maye not only doesn't have these limitations, its something he's doing pretty much every play, and something he projects to do better at the nfl than caleb and bryce imo

But this is how I break down the games.  

Las Vegas   Winnable, if Bagent doesn't implode and the offensive line gives him a little protection  Win possibility 50%

LA Chargers   Again, the offensive line does a decent job protecting, this could be a close game.   Win possibility 30%

New Orleans Saints.  Looked absolutely brutal on both sides of the ball, the players have lost faith in David Carr.   Win possibility 55%

Carolina Panthers    They really have nothing on either side of the ball.  Best chance for a win  65%

Detroit Lions in Detroit.  The Lions look good, really good, but the possibility that this is a trap game for Detroit exists.   Win possibility  20%",CHIBears,126,18,0.65,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17cntji/predict_the_bears_next_win/,football,NA

I think if we want success, we  need to have a proven veteran ahead of whoever it is we draft to learn and not have huge expectations. If we grab Cousins, it would not cause QB drama as he would be the current starter and the rookie could sit a year. Plus it would give us a legitimate chance to have a competent offense. 

We also would get a true view on how good or bad our Oline is. Some weeks I don't know if the Oline was bad or if fields just wasn't pulling the trigger. Having a proven veteran QB would show us how good the guys on our line are. 

I am not sure they will move on from fields and I'm no pro at putting together a team, but I think this would be a good route to go. It would give us a year extra with our current coaches too, which would be definitive of showing if they are any good or if they just need to be fired.

But from the second Poles/Flus got here, it's been nothing but the opposite. 

First, it was the treatment of Jenkins. Relegating him to 3rd string &amp; trying to trade him, only to realize your OL is dogshit &amp; you need him to play because he's your best player on the line.

Then it was rumblings of Jaylon Johnson, your best CB, not getting starter snaps in camp.

Then it was the treatment of Roquan, who was your only true blue chip talent that openly stated he wanted to be here. You let him walk (which was fine in the moment), only to pay Edmunds top 3 LB money. 

Then it was bringing in a known locker room cancer like Chase Claypool for a 2nd. 

Now we are talking about taking trade calls for Jaylon &amp; Mooney, two solid players who are beloved in the locker room.

Meanwhile your team has won 4 games out of 23.

Is anybody else dumbfounded by some of this shit? It makes no sense. Seems like Poles just wants to move on from anything Pace related.

2023-10-19,1697677240,"Poles has done a great job, and the Bears shouldn't draft MHJ (rant)","I'm seeing a lot of hate for Poles from Bears fans and I honestly don't get it. I'll leave the didn't draft Fields, and flus wasn't his choice arguments aside, because they're obvious, but I'll lay out a few examples of why I think Poles is the dude.

-when Poles took over the biggest weaknesses from a front office perspective were Cap space, an aging roster, and a lack of draft capitol. Those are now all strengths. He turned the cap situation around almost over night, took 5 picks he was given in his first draft(no 1st) and turned those into 10, and turned their first last year into a stud Oline man, DJ Moore, and what could be the number 1 pick this year.

-He didn't overpay for a WR like Kirk in his first offseason, and got Moore for less money a year later. Did the same thing this year avoiding overpaying for a OLineman in free agency. They are trying to build through the draft which takes some time, but he's been making moves that set you up for success. We've seen what chasing immediate success does for quite some time here in Chicago, I'm surprised so many can't see that they're finally doing something right.

-His biggest mistake so far has been trading for Claypool. It was a bad move, but one that several GMs were lining up to make. I absolutely loved the fact that he cut ties so quickly, and didn't get stuck into sunken cost. Every GM makes a bad trade or draft pick, but the good ones correct their errors quickly.

-Now for MHJ. Let's just assume that the bears 2 1st are top 5 picks, and let's also assume that their first pick is a QB. That second pick should either be OL, or a trade back to get more OL/DL. In fact, outside of a QB all of the Bears early draft picks should be in the trenches. MHJ is going to be amazing, but they are fine at WR, and it doesn't matter how good the QB they draft is if they don't fix the OL. 

It would absolutely be a mistake to let Poles go after the season. Let Eberflus go, and trade fields = , but Poles may actually be the dude they need to right the ship.",CHIBears,239,0,0.36,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17b6k11/poles_has_done_a_great_job_and_the_bears_shouldnt/,football,NA

We had the same rate of bad snaps from shotgun as this bears team.  Bad snaps were considered to be one of our bigger issues, and we won 3 games in 2 years.

So do any centers have input? Is this something people fix, or is it like a curse that some lineman just never get down? Also, if you are a center and can snap consistently, could you try out for the bears pls?

Fast forward to this year and Roquan has been one of the best linebackers in the entire NFL (thoroughly unsurprising now that he's on a competent defense) and Tremaine Edmunds has been...fine. I hope it was worth saving fucking $2 million a year Ryan.

Are we really about to do the same shit again with one of the few players we've drafted and developed recently? He has the best coverage grade in the NFL this year and has consistently been one of the best cover corners in the league.

And the knock on him is...that he doesn't get enough picks? The dude never gets thrown at cuz he blankets his receiver (and for the last couple years because he was our only competent corner back). I feel like Sunday showed he has the ability to produce the turnovers and splash plays if given the opportunity. It's not like he's dropped a bunch of easy picks in his Bears career.

2023-10-24,1698154825,OC Play calling vs. QB,"I only get to watch highlights (cause I'm cheap and a long way from Chicago), but I'm curious and haven't seen commentary on this subject...does it look like the OC is calling different kinds of plays with Bagent in there?  Looking at the run-game stats, it kinda looks like it.  The highlights and QB analysis videos I've seen look like the OC is calling plays that suit Bagent while the older highlights look like completely braindead play calling that assumes Fields is Rogers.  Plus, the run game...it seems like previously the run game was cruising and then stupid pass plays would be called.  There seems to have been more commitment to the run game with Bagent in there.

So, is the OC calling plays more suited to the QB with Bagent in there?  I'm not in any QB camp, I'm in the Bears camp...I want to see every Bears player do well, but I'm wondering if maybe the OC is learning how to call a game properly for the talent that is on the field.  If so, we can hope that if/when Fields returns, the OC calls plays that suit his strengths.

Thoughts?  I haven't seen the games for real...am I mislead by only seeing highlights/analysis?

2023-10-24,1698112391,Draft/Rookie Takes,"# Preface

This post has nothing to do with Poles, Caleb Williams, Drake Maye, Olu Fashanu, MHJ, Jalen Carter, Justin Fields, etc... except for in the manner explicitly stated.  In no way are these a defense or attack of/on any of them.

Also, the purpose of it is explicitly stated below, and any additional meanings interpreted from it are due to the readers inability to read this post level headed and must, instead, let their emotions dictate and obfuscate the true meaning.

# TL;DR

We need to stop posting such bad, baseless, knee jerk draft takes/player evaluations on this sub.  Draft Prospects have terrible games, and, the best rookies at a certain position from a draft class do not always stay the best.

# Post

Alright, so I know Bears twitter/reddit just started caring about the draft when Poles took over and began stashing picks, so I understand why some of you may not understand why your draft and/or rookie performance takes are cringe worthy.

But, for the sake of my sanity, I am going to try to explain what exactly drives people like myself, someone who loves draft season (and player evals since we need to see how we did on our draft takes), up a wall.

If you do not want to tell on yourself, and do not want to look like you don't know ball or, really, follow football in any type of manner outside of watching Bears games, please refrain from the takes I am about to discuss (If you are like myself, feel free to share this post when responding to these takes).

# Take 1: X draft prospect played like shit in that game, I don't get why he's so overhyped.

Before you assume I am defending Caleb Williams, please refer to the preface.  I have seen this exact type of statement for several prospects this and last year including Williams, Maye, Fashanu, and others.  

I am not even close to completing my personal draft analysis for the year and do not have an educated opinion on any of them, but I do know that opinions like this are terrible (even if the player ends up sucking, shit like this is almost ignorant as you haven't seen nearly enough tape to judge them, and lack the ability to if you did since no one that knows what they're looking for would say this).

Here's the thing, everyone has a bad game or two! Shit, they could even have 3! There are so many factors that go into how a player performs, and almost all of them are hard to judge when watching the broadcast view, especially when you aren't rewinding and watching critical plays closely.  

Basing them off of ""well he sucked when I watched him the like 2 times"" is absolute none sense. 

Lets look at examples of players who have had bad games in College (some of which led to bad Draft takes creeping their ugly heads onto Twitter/Reddit):

* Jalen Carter - I saw bears fan tear into him after his game against OSU in the playoffs. On top of that, he had poor performances against Oregon and Florida.
* These takes literally only came from people who had no clue, because if you did, you would have known that he was also the best player on the historic 2021 UGA Defense as a Sophomore and was sad that he was not draft eligible yet. 
* (please see preface - this is not a Poles post and will not respond to anyone defending or attacking his decision to trade back)
* Aiden Hutchinson - His games against Georgia and Penn State were used to justify having Walker and Kayvon Thibodeaux ahead of him (IMO the former made no sense at all while the latter I could understand at the time)
* Chase Young - Lots of bad takes going in on him being neutralized as a pass rusher by Rashawn Slater.
* Christian Wirfs - Had a terrible game against Michigan
* Charles Cross - Arkansas, Ole Miss, Kentucky
* Justin Fields - Indiana and Northwestern games were absolutely torn apart
* Trevor Lawrence - OSU playoff game, VT, and Miami were also highly criticized
* Justin Herbert - literally all of his last 3 games
* Tua - A&amp;M, Tenn
* Lamar Jackson - Clemson, NC State
* Patrick Mahomes - West Virginia, Iowa State

I could list bad games from the last season of almost\* every QB and several other players at various positions drafted recently (\*except maybe Burrow).

But have I really not gotten the point across yet?  Players have bad games.  Literally NFL greats have had bad games in College.

If you've ever watched football on a regular basis, and actually paid attention and had some semblance of a memory, you'd know this.

# Take 2: X rookie is better than Y rookie at this position, I can't believe (insert team - could be any including the Bears) passed on them for this other player at that position

Want to know something funny? In the last 10 years, the best rookie QB has only gone on to be the best QB from their draft class once.

* 2021: Mac Jones =&gt; Trevor Lawerence
* 2020: Justin Herbert =&gt; Joe Burrrrrr
* 2019: Gardner Minshew Mania =&gt; Kyler Murray (I think people who watch knew who was better)
* 2018: Baker Mayfield =&gt; Lamar/Josh Allen
* 2017\*: Watson =&gt; Mahomes 
   * \*Obviously Mahomes didn't really play, and Watson could have been the best of the rookies that did play if Karma didn't strike his ass down.
* 2016: Carson Wentz =&gt; Dak Prescott
* 2015: Jameis Winston =&gt; Jameis Winston
* 2014: Teddy Bridgewater =&gt; Derek Carr/Jimmy G (I'm not deciding this mid-off)
* 2013\*\*: Mike Glenon =&gt; Geno Smith
* 2012: Russell Wilson =&gt; Andrew Luck
   * \*\*This QB class sucked until Geno resurrected his career, so it's kind of hard to say this is a good example of what I am getting at, hence me adding 2012.

I can do this for a lot of positions, but I believe I have made my point, and, if you don't believe me, you should do yourself a favor and look at individual draft classes and truly think about how that class has evolved over the years.  It's a great exercise and would really teach you a lot about player development (also, this is taking too long to write).

Which brings me to my next point...

# Take 3: Can we even trust Poles in the draft when X, Y, Z rookie hasn't performed in the first 6 weeks of their NFL career (or 2022 draft class beyond day 2 being called busts since day 3 picks are longshots).

This one should be obvious, yet I see it everywhere.  The fact that this type of stupid is so prevalent makes me cringe to my core.

Rookies take time to adjust to the speed of the game.  To expect them to just start performing immediately against grown ass men and vets of the game is sort of asinine.

Does it happen? Yeah definitely!  Especially at certain positions.

But to judge anyone from the most recent draft based on a handful of games is just asking to get egg on your face down the line when they are very good.

Also, most college prospects come into the NFL fairly raw, especially those that play in the trenches. Honestly, most trench players in college win by leaning on one or two techniques that translate to the NFL, so unless they're absolute freak athletes (Tristan Wirfs), have somehow learned several advanced techniques (Rashawn Slater, Hutchinson), or are considered elite can't miss talents for a multitude of reasons (Jalen Carter, Penei Sewell), then you shouldn't expect them to hit the ground running.

For every Jalen Carter, there's multiple Dexter Lawrences or Quinnen Williams.  For every Rashawn Slater, there's multiple Andrew Thomas or Christian Darrisaw.

Now, in no way am I saying any of the rookies are surefire hits.  All I am saying is, it's way too damn early to judge this rookie class.  Like it's stupid early, and we have so little tape to judge them by that it's stupid little tape, hence this being a stupid little take that's stupid early to have. 

Personally, I do not solidify my opinion on a player in the NFL until it's close to the end of their 2nd season playing, and even that is premature as 3rd year breakouts happen.

We can debate how he did in 2021, but one draft class is not nearly enough to judge a GM on, and it was mostly day 3 picks that are hard to hit on beyond special team contributor/depth piece.

But again, this is not a defense or Attack of Ryan Poles, so I will not share my opinion here outside of saying that it is really dumb to judge a GM based on a single draft class or draft pick.  The best of them have had terrible drafts let alone picks.

All I am saying is, it's still way to premature to have this take.",CHIBears,20,39,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17f1gec/draftrookie_takes/,football,NA

Also the defense is starting to look better.

Also i dont think hes been bad at time management (way better than Nagy).    Everyone complained about the end of the first half but imo it was smart winning football to not call a timeout until you converted the 3rd and 7.  You cant give them a chance to score if you dont convert the 3rd down, being up 2 scores.

2023-10-23,1698090778,Bagent and 3rd Down Success,"I'm not saying Bagent is better than Fields. But he does seem better at having success in short game. And the place that seems to be showing in our stats is with 3rd down success. Unsure if it's because they're more manageable given less negative plays, like sacks, or he's doing better at converting as well. But stats are noticable.

Bagent so far is 12/19 on 3rd down in a game and a half. Fields is 26/71 this season. That's basically 63% vs 33%. 

I'm not trying to have this be some big takeaway about the future of our QBs, but more than anything it makes me nervous that a undrafted rookie is having that much more success than Fields in one of the key measurements of success. Bagent didn't have many big time throws, but we really need Fields to show he can do some of the same things Bagent did Sunday when the situation calls for it.

Well... life happened and I had my first kid in '21.  

A coworker of mine has a PSL and sells them at cost - section 250 and aisle seats.  I snatched them up for the game when he offered.  

Had the babysitter set up to come at 9:30 this morning - thinking it's 45 minutes to Soldier, maybe an hour 15 at worst, get there by 11.  

NOT WHAT HAPPENED.  

Took an hour forty-five to get there, waited in the South Lot line without a pass because I thought there would be cash parking.  Nope.  Attendant told me to head to the Purple Adler Lot, there I went.  They were sold out of cash parking.  I pulled over on Solidarity Drive and reflected on my life while my wife tried to find something - ANYTHING - on SpotHero.  I was ready to just go home.  We found a $90 parking garage on 13th Street, that was a half hour walk from the North Gate.  

We got to our seats at 12:18.  

The Bears scored about 5 minutes later.  FUCK YEA IT WAS WORTH IT!

Then season starts and we lose 2. A terrible screen call in the Bucs game + lack of Chunk plays people wants Luke Getsys head cuz we weren't throwing down the field.

Then against the broncos and commanders Fields plays more loose and throws down the field and puts up great stats. Defense fucks us out of a win vs broncos, and with commanders lots of 1 v 1 wins.

The against the Vikings Bagent and company move the ball down the field and they make a terrible call to go deep on 1st down and it's severely under thrown.

Then today Bagent takes all the check downs and short plays. Very efficient with good completion % plus an actually good rushing attack.

It seems like people really don't know what Bears should do they only want what works. And what works is determined after the fact.

2023-10-29,1698596693,Fields vs. Williams,"I was curious on how each performed vs ranked teams in college and looked up their stats. I am tired of hearing how much better Williams is as a prospect compared to Fields when he is mainly beating up on lowly teams, while struggling more against proper opponents. Spoiler alert, the NFL will have a good opponent every week.

Fields (2019, 2020) faced 11 ranked teams, the average of the rank of teams was 10.45. His stats are below:

Cmp Pct: 63.17 (avg)

Yds: 254.60 (avg)

TD: 27 (total)

Int: 9 (total)

Rating: 160.01 (avg)

&amp;#x200B;

Williams (2022, 2023) I omitted his freshman year to keep it as comparable as possible. He has faced 7 ranked teams so far, the avg rank of those teams being 15.54. Stats below:

Cmp Pct: 68.72

Yds: 304.55

TDs: 17

Int: 6

Rating: 145.74

&amp;#x200B;

As it stands now, Williams will face 3 more ranked teams, so these numbers will change, but a few things stood out to me:

1.) Fields faced higher ranked teams than Williams has and has very comparable stats

2.) Fields has a higher rating vs ranked teams than Williams has (If Williams goes nuts vs the upcoming ranked teams, this gap could close)

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I do not believe for a second that Williams is a ""Generational Prospect"". He beats up on lowly teams, and plays in a QB friendly offense under a highly regarded QB friendly HC. I am not a football analyst by any means, but I really feel strongly in my gut that Williams will be an above avg QB in the NFL at best. I do not think he can save the Bears to the extent needed to warrant a #1 pick. Fields was just as good as a prospect coming out of college and the stats back it up.  I like Fields. I want him to be the guy. If he isn't then he isn't, but I do not want this team to take a slightly different version of him expecting different results. I know these comparisons are not completely apples to apples, but this is what he have. I am sure some NFL Data guys have stats that may refute my findings completely, but numbers aside, the ""eye test"" is a real metric and Williams, especially these past few games has not passed that test.",CHIBears,172,17,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17j6j0g/fields_vs_williams/,football,NA

Your chances to win a game with an average QB might be 50%, and with a backup drop to 25%. But with Nathan Peterman or late-career Foles, it was 5% or less. The backup QB position needs to be thought of as a whole separate auxiliary spot on the roster, like KR or longsnapper or something. The starter WILL go down at some point in the season, your backup will get some reps.

That's why it's so important to have a guy you can trust behind center, and I'm excited what Fields can do in the role, even if Bagent gets hurt.",CHIBears,58,167,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17j3eot/stop_searching_the_bears_have_found_their_qb2/,football,NA

2023-10-28,1698533242,It's time to end this Fields-Bagent Civil War.,"This discourse has gotten old very quick. If you want someone to put this Bagent-Fields BS to bed with rationale and reason, read on - I'm that dude.

Just because some fans want to see more from Tyson Bagent before they crown him as the savior, they're being labeled Bagent haters.

First off, there's no such thing as a true Chicago Bears fan who is a Bagent hater. They are just rational fans who want a bigger sample size, and maybe they believe (with good reason) that Fields has been dealt a terrible hand by our organization before this year so they still believe in his talent and want to make sure Bagent can truly eclipse that talent weekly.

The Raiders played so shitty last Sunday that I didn't learn a ton about Bagent other than he makes quick decisions and he's capable of being a solid game manager.

It was impossible to learn more because the Raiders blow and Josh McDaniels is so up his own ass that he doesn't realize that AARP member Brian Hoyer can't lace Aidan O'Connell's cleats whether it's preseason or not.

Point is, routine game managers don't get promoted to franchise QB status. That's not how the NFL works in 2023. Hell, it didn't work that way in 2009 when game managing savant Kyle Orton was here either. That's why we dealt him for Cutler.

Can Bagent earn that franchise status? Sure! But why the hell would I bank on that right now? It makes no sense without more evidence.

I want to see Bagent go deep when it's available and stretch the field to keep the defense honest. I want to see Bagent face in-game adversity and see how he responds. I want to see how well he can move the offense down the field if our run game gets stuffed. I want to see if he can win the game off his arm or legs or both when the defense allows 24+ points like they did for 14 straight games with Fields at the helm until a few weeks ago.

Why is there something wrong with that&? If Bagent aces those tests, I'm all in on QB1 Bagent! But if he's limited in certain regards, then that's okay too. I think no matter what he will be a great backup for us long-term, which is extremely valuable.

This weird Civil War among the fanbase is silly as hell, when literally all of us can make the smartest, healthiest decision - to let it play out and see what happens.

The only QB on that entire list who's consistently led a super bowl contending team year in and year out (regardless of ebbs amd flows with talent around him) is Mahomes. He's the unicorn.

Every other QB on that list has had huge ups and fairly big downs due to a variety of reasons. Coaching changes, lack of talent around him, injuries etc. I don't think you can plug and play any of them (even though some are ""proven"" as great) and expect them to thrive. 

The common denominator for success seems to be great coaching (and gm roster management) that works in concert with a talented/dedicated QB. 

Which all leads me to say I think the Bears need to focus on finding a proven coach to install a proven system and keep Fields. 

Hoping and praying that the next rookie QB is going to be ""the one,"" is the best way to the Bears right back to where they are right now.

Edit: sorry, I'm always bad at saying what I'm trying to say. I'm not saying that HoF QBs aren't the most important thing to have in football. I'm saying, you don't simply draft a HoF QB. You develop him by surrounding him with competent coaching and talent. Until the coaching part is fixed, it's wrong to keep focusing on the QB the Bears need to draft because they'll likely just ruin him.",CHIBears,218,111,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17gcav5/looking_for_a_hof_qb_is_a_fools_errand/,football,NA

2023-10-25,1698242890,Scenario: we don't land the #1 overall pick,"Everyone on here is focused on the future, for good reason, but almost all speculations assume we get the 1st pick in the draft. What if we don't?

Realistically, I think we will win 4-6 games. We have one of the easiest schedules ahead and while we still suck, we are good enough to squeak out a few more wins, regardless of whether it's Fields or Bagent at QB. 

There's a lot of bad teams in the league this year, almost every division has a stinker that could potentially land the #1 overall. I think it's fairly likely that 4 wins could be too many to be guaranteed that pick. 

We are much more likely to get the #1 overall via Carolina. They are pretty bad, but have a few winnable games ahead of them. Let's assume for the sake of argument that Carolina manages to pull off a few wins, enough to knock them out of the #1 spot. How should we approach the draft?

Do we trade up and go get our guy? Do we take what we have and run with it? What are people's thoughts?

I think no matter what the #1 pick will be Caleb Williams. If the team with the 1st pick doesn't want him, they will trade down to a team that does. I also think the Bears should draft a QB. However, I'm not sold enough on Caleb Williams to trade up and grab him. Nothing has convinced me that he's worth it. I think we'd be better off taking what we got, as we will still most likely have a top 5 pick, and going with a guy like Drake Maye, saving our other 1st round pick for another beast.

2023-10-25,1698207627,Can we seriously stop pretending like there is any kind of debate who should start at QB right now,"I want you guys to take a look at [this](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BageTy00/gamelog/2023/advanced/), which are the advanced stats for bagent so far. Notice how he had only *FORTY ONE* intended air yards the whole game sunday, for 1.8 air yards per attempt

I know you guys want to talk about how bagent had a clean game, but he literally was averaging under 2 yards per throw, it's not that hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a sign of Getsy's shortcomings so far. The bears #1 weapon is DJ Moore, and then after that it's probably Fields' rushing. Kmet is a solid big body redzone target, but thats about it. Mooney is fine, but he hasn't been able to excel on his own. 

However when you look at our RB room, we have the running back with the highest ypc last year, Foreman who is averaging 5 ypc so far, and a promising rookie who has been trucking people.

This should be blatantly obvious that the strengths of the bears offense is not in passing. Fields looks bad when he has to pass, just because this team is straight up not built for that. He has only had success passing when DJ Moore has had a big game, which should again be abundantly clear he is the only threat in the passing game. But when Bagent comes in and the gameplan is to get the ball to the RBs, all of the sudden we have an offense. Additionally, the strength in oline clearly is in run blocking and less so in pass protection.

&amp;#x200B;

Getsy has just been trying to turn this team into something it's not, because his only prior nfl experience is with a pure pocket passer in aaron rodgers. The scheme *NEEDS* to be around our weapons, which is running the football. This short threat will then allow big plays from Fields and Moore, we haven't really seen any huge scrambles from Fields because the offense hasn't been run first this year, like it was last year. Bagent will never be able to crib it from 60 yards and we can't pretend Fields isn't better because of his athleticism.",CHIBears,123,0,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17fwi7w/can_we_seriously_stop_pretending_like_there_is/,football,NA

2023-11-01,1698798384,"I went down a Montez Sweat rabbit hole. I learned that he is a foundational player and very likely one of the top 3 most athletic Chicago Bears currently on the roster. No... really, here's a quick synopsis of what I found with some stats/data","T**his man is a Madden create-a-character with stats set to all 99s.** He is an absolute freak of nature and his production and experience means he is an immediate force for the Bears this week, and for years to come.

I couldn't believe it either, but I do now, and I'll try to condense some of the salient bits as follows.

Couple quick sources I started with here, and at the bottom:

* RAS site with data studies team view, etc: [https://ras.football/](https://ras.football/)
* Montez Sweat RAS Data: [https://ras.football/2020/01/12/montez-sweat-ras/](https://ras.football/2020/01/12/montez-sweat-ras/)
* Great 8 min video by Swift Sports Network [Bears trade for STAR Pass Rusher MONTEZ SWEAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFxeeiDB8Ys&amp;t=223s)
* Montez Sweat's NFL stat page: [https://www.nfl.com/players/montez-sweat/](https://www.nfl.com/players/montez-sweat/)

So, like any good bears fan I started looking for a downside with Sweat after reading some basics. Maybe 3-4 hours later I'd given up on work and went full time Montez investigator and I'm actively calling friends and family like a goddamn 50s office switchboard operator to spread the good news. I feel like this guy wasn't on a lot of our radars.

The point of this post is so that you know Montez Sweat will:

* Make the B**ears Defense watchable starting this Sunday**
* Be the same kind of **long-term, cornerstone rusher that Khalil Mack and Julius Peppers were.**
* Is a really significant signing. We should be freaking out. **He is the defensive equivalent of DJ Moore without spending a 1st round pick.**

Sweat is a big boy: **6'6"" 262lbs and and with a 7'3/4"" wingspan.** He genuinely looks like Bigfoot and he is scary athletic.

Sweat ran **a 4:41 40-yard dash** at the combine in 2019. **He was the first defensive lineman to do so since 2003**, and only two HBs were faster than him that year.

Watching some of his highlights made me recall a bigger, faster Julius Peppers: long, strong and fast both in open space and in more nimble cuts. He gets past guys because of his frame and athleticism.

At **27 years old** he is just entering his prime and he is already in very elite company. Last season he had over 60 pressures. The Bear's leader in pressures totaled somewhere in the 30s (pressures data is paywall protected by PFF - I could not recall the exact values and am looking for the original YouTube source)

He is Elite. We got a BARGAIN. Montez is one of **only seven players with at least five sacks, every season, for the last five consecutive seasons:**

That list is:

* Myles Garret
* TJ Watt
* Khalil Mack
* Brian Burns
* Maxx Crosby
* Chris Jones
* Montez Sweat.

From everything I see on tape or read about him, his sheer athleticism combined with his size is why I know we just picked up a guy who's going to be a force that defines this Bear's decade. The RAS score is a value distilled from common combine tests (more info on the site below). Montez's Relative Athletic Score (RAS) speaks to just how well Sweat is able to move and his athleticism is insane.

Most players have these but not all. Below is a table with a few players from the Bears, Sweat's position peers, and NFL notables to help contextualize things:

*(Jalen Carter and Justin Fields did not have an RAS that I could find.)*

Player - RAS#

|Montez Sweat - 9.9|Justin Jefferson - 9.69|Cody Whitehair - 7.99|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Demarcus Walker - 3.19|Tom Brady - 2.74|DJ Moore - 9.65|

We're staying in the French Quarter.

We'll show up with snacks and beer! Or whatever else you request that we can carry.

A little context: my dad, sister, and I go to a Bears game together every year (since 2010!). We usually go to Soldier or close enough to drive and tailgate, but we all now live in separate states so we decided to fly into a different town and not rent a car. So this is new territory for us.

2023-11-02,1698927583,Montez Sweat Contract Talks,"Can someone more knowledgeable on how trades and contract talks work between teams?  I'm reading bits and pieces about how we wouldn't have been able to speak to Sweat's agent about contract extensions unless Washington gave us permission (otherwise it's tampering).  

How does this compare to the trade for Khalil Mack when we traded two 1sts and more?  Did the Raiders give us permission to discuss contract negotiations with him before trading to us?  We announced the extension just hours after trading for Mack back in 2018.

The biggest difference I see is that Mack was moved in the offseason and Sweat was moved midseason.  Mack got traded Sept 1 2018 and they announced his extension Sept 2.  

On another note, how much leverage does Sweat really have in contract talks with us?  He's a star, but he's not a super star.  The vast majority of players just want long term security.  They hate being in contract years or franchise tagged because playing poorly or getting injured would totally ruin their value.  It is a huge risk on their part and yes, sometimes it pays off a ton, but there are also plenty of examples where it does not.

EDIT:  Just a quick comparison with Roquan, which is probably a better one:  Roquan was traded to the Ravens for a 2nd rounder in October.  The Ravens didn't get a contract done with him until Jan.  Were the Ravens under as much pressure as the Bears to get a deal done?  I get that they were pushing for the playoffs and trying to win (and the Bears clearly aren't in a winning position).  However, that's still a 2nd rounder for a ""rental"" if they didn't get a deal done.  I get that some people are saying the Bears could have waited until FA to pay Sweat or whatever, but there's no guarantee that Sweat wouldn't have been resigned by Washington before hitting FA.",CHIBears,69,36,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17m27mf/montez_sweat_contract_talks/,football,NA

It's not like Alan Williams and David Walker are telling their friends and employers about all the shit they do behind the scenes in their personal life. I'm just glad they have the wherewithal to root out people that reflect negatively on the organization. 

Some guys are abysmal people and last years in an organization because they have deep ties to the league. 

This thought that they would never be hired if the coaches could evaluate character is horseshit. How many of you have worked a job where management brought someone in only to find out later own down the line he has character issues? It happens ALL THE TIME. 

Like, shit, ik y'all ain't perfect either. I could only imagine how many people on this sub alone would be in deep shit in their own workplace if management discovered what was occurring in your own lives. For one, you (we) are all nasty Bears fans. Two, you're telling me you or someone you know had never made a crude or mean comment about a fellow employee? Imagine if that circulated, you'd wind up just like David Walker. 

It's unsurprising, frankly, that this billionaire boys club of uber-masculine personalities has people with character issues. It's even more surprising that Alan Williams and David Walker are the only two to find their way out of an organization for it. Hell, Deshaun Watson is STILL quarterbacking in this league and Robert Kraft ran a goddamn prostitution ring, yet they're still here. 

If anything, this seems like character accountability to me. But what do I know&I'm just an arm chair gm like the rest of you punks.

2023-11-01,1698860283,Dane Brugler's mid-season 2024 Draft Big Board (Top 12),"EDIT: I didn't see u/biasedbearsfan post before me so go look at [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17lfz5z/the_athletic_dane_brugler_nfl_draft_2024_big/)

Here's the top 12 (out of 50) of his draft board so you can see for yourself instead of posting a single movement to misleadingly put down certain prospects.

#1. Drake Maye - QB, North Carolina

Cut from the same cloth as Justin Herbert, Maye (2,559 yards passing, 22 total TDs) continues to impress with his on-field command despite inconsistent help around him. A tall, well-put-together athlete, he has an explosive release with the touch to threaten every level of the field.

He still makes a few more reckless decisions than you'd want, but his timing has improved, and his aggressive decision-making is more of a strength than a weakness.

#2. Marvin Harrison Jr. - WR, Ohio State

The best wide receiver prospect that I have evaluated over the last decade, Harrison (48 catches for 889 yards and eight TDs) offers a rare package of physical traits and savvy, and it has made him nearly uncoverable at the college level. His athletic dexterity and instincts, both as a route runner and at the catch point, are what really separate him  especially for a 6-foot-4 receiver.

Although he isn't as physically imposing as Julio Jones, there are several similarities between the two, including the way they play strong to the football.

#3. Caleb Williams - QB, USC

I'm all for a ban of the word generational when talking about college prospects, because it sets near-unattainable expectations and makes a player like Williams an easy target for criticism. That said, Williams (2,646 yards passing, 34 total TDs) remains an extremely impressive prospect. He has an above-average arm and a natural feel for accuracy, and his ability to weaponize his creativity remains a differentiating factor between him and most quarterbacks.

Williams is fantastic at navigating chaos, but he does hold the ball too long at times. Often he has no choice, either because a defense gets immediate pressure with its front four or his receivers haven't created separation. And when that happens, Williams feels forced to put on the superhero cape, which can lead to negative plays.

With the bar set so high, it can be easy to call Williams overrated after a mistake, but let's not lose sight of his tremendous strengths as a player.

#4. Brock Bowers - TE, Georgia

Some will scoff at the sight of a tight end carrying this ranking, but the No. 1 goal for any team picking this high is to draft a difference-maker. Bowers (41 catches for 567 yards, five total TDs) is exactly that.

More of a receiver/tight end hybrid, Bowers has speed and athleticism that jump off the screen. His physicality is almost as impressive, both as a blocker and after the catch, where he is master of picking up those hidden yards. I thought this quote from an area scout was a perfect summation: He's a 21-year-old George Kittle. That'll get him drafted (in the) top seven.

#5. Olu Fashanu - OT, Penn State

At 6 feet 6 and 321 pounds with 34 3/8-inch arms, Fashanu is one of the best pass-protecting tackle prospects in recent years. He shows an outstanding blend of size, movement skills and body control to easily access his anchor. His intelligence and character are also strong selling points.

Scouts want to see a more aggressive approach from him, especially in the run game.

#6. Joe Alt - OT, Notre Dame

Alt already was clearly a first-round prospect based on his sophomore film, but he looks even better as a junior  it won't be a surprise if he finishes as OT1 for some NFL teams. For a tall blocker (nearly 6 feet 8), he does a terrific job with his redirect and recovery, and you'll rarely see him stressed.

Even though he didn't become a full-time offensive lineman until college, Alt plays with impressive technique and pad level.

#7. Dallas Turner - Edge, Alabama

When it comes to rushing the passer, Turner checks the boxes for both traits and production. He is explosive off the ball and into contact, and he plays with exceptional pursuit speed to chase down the football.

Turner is currently the only FBS player ranked top five nationally in sacks (7.0), pressures, pass-rush win rate and pass-rush win percentage.

#8. Keon Coleman - WR, Florida State

Because Coleman wasn't yet a well-known name, I received some pushback when he debuted as WR4 in my initial positional rankings in July. Fast forward to the present, and the Michigan State transfer isn't a secret any longer.

With his size/speed athleticism and acrobatic ball skills, Coleman (38 catches for 538 yards and nine TDs) is a freakish talent with the chance to be a dominant player. His flashes remind me of how Demaryius Thomas played when he was at Georgia Tech.

#9. Laiatu Latu - Edge, UCLA

Similar to 2021 first-round pick Jaelen Phillips (both in terms of skill level and personal journey), Latu is an interesting prospect. He plays with only average bend, his arms aren't very long and his medical history is a potential concern. But his motor runs hot, and he has a graduate degree in rush technique  specializing in cross-chops, arm-overs and lightning-fast hands.

Latu has accounted for a ridiculous 106 pressures in 21 games since he transferred to UCLA prior to last season.

#10. JC Latham - OT, Alabama

A massive blocker, Latham carries his weight well in pass protection and plays with exceptional strength from head to toe. In the run game, he creates movement at contact and specializes in dumping linebackers at the second level.

He needs to be more consistent with his strike placement and protecting versus inside moves, but Latham has quickly and consistently improved since he arrived in Tuscaloosa. He has the goods to be a starting NFL right tackle next year.

#11. Rome Odunze - WR, Washington

What's not to like? Odunze is a verified 6 feet 2 7/8 and 217 pounds. He glides on the football field with plenty of speed (he won a state title in the 200 meters in high school), and he has natural receiving instincts plus the coordination to cleanly snatch the football.

I liked Odunze (51 catches for 907 yards and seven TDs) when I studied him over the summer, but I didn't give him enough credit for the way he can impact the game.

#12. Chop Robinson - Edge, Penn State

For Robinson (5.0 tackles for loss, 3.0 sacks) to be ranked this highly, it'd be great if he was more consistently dominant. But he'll go on heaters (see: the Iowa tape), where he'll just take over games for stretches with his instant speed and aggressive hands. He is a better prospect than Will McDonald IV, who was drafted No. 15 this past April.

Robinson exited the Ohio State game last Saturday with an injury and had to be carted to the locker room, but Penn State hopes to get him back soon.

#Other Notes

Dane's blurb about Maye/Caleb from the article:

* ""Like I wrote back in July for my quarterback preview, the gap between USC's Caleb Williams and North Carolina's Drake Maye is razor-thin. Both are dynamic prospects, and the league will be split on who deserves the QB1 designation. But then there is Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr., who might be most-deserving of the best prospect tag for this draft class.""
* 10 WRs in the top 50
* 8 OTs in the top 50

2023-11-01,1698855998,[The Athletic - Dane Brugler] NFL Draft 2024 Big Board: Possible Draft Targets for the Bears,"[From Dan's top-50](https://theathletic.com/5014354/2023/11/01/nfl-draft-2024-prospect-rankings-midseason/?source=user_shared_article), I only included the top QBs, WRs, OL, EDGE, and CBs.  I left the number they were ranked, but it is organized by their position. Let me now if there was anyone from Dan's list that I excluded that you wanted the description on.

&gt;QBs -

**1. Drake Maye 6'4 230** \- Cut from the same cloth as Justin Herbert, Maye (2,559 yards passing, 22 total TDs) continues to impress with his on-field command despite inconsistent help around him. A tall, well-put-together athlete, he has an explosive release with the touch to threaten every level of the field. He still makes a few more reckless decisions than you'd want, but his timing has improved, and his aggressive decision-making is more of a strength than a weakness.

**3. Caleb Williams 6-1 220** \- I'm all for a ban of the word generational when talking about college prospects, because it sets near-unattainable expectations and makes a player like Williams an easy target for criticism. That said, Williams (2,646 yards passing, 34 total TDs) remains an extremely impressive prospect.

And when that happens, Williams feels forced to put on the superhero cape, which can lead to negative plays. With the bar set so high, it can be easy to call Williams overrated after a mistake, but let's not lose sight of his tremendous strengths as a player.

**16. J.J. McCarthy 6-3 196** \- Two months after entering the season as my QB3, McCarthy (1,799 yards passing, 21 total TDs) hasn't done anything to surrender that spot. He is completing 78.1 percent of his passes with an 18- to-3 touchdown-to-interception ratio, while doing some of his best work on the move. Considering Michigan's schedule, NFL scouts are taking a wait-and-see approach with McCarthy  the month of November (featuring games at Penn State and versus Ohio State) will determine a lot.

**24. Shedeur Sanders 6-2 215** \- As my preseason QB6, Sanders just missed the initial top 50 in August. He absolutely earned his way onto the list this time with his play over the season's first two months. Sanders (2,637 yards passing, 25 total TDs) is guilty of holding the ball for too long when big-play hunting, but his ability to keep plays alive is an asset. Though he could use another year of seasoning, Sanders has the poise and physical talent to warrant a first-round pick if he declares for the 2024 draft.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;WR

**2. WR Marvin Harrison Jr. 6-4 205** \- The best wide receiver prospect that I have evaluated over the last decade, Harrison (48 catches for 889 yards and eight TDs) offers a rare package of physical traits and savvy, and it has made him nearly uncoverable at the college level. His athletic dexterity and instincts, both as a route runner and at the catch point, are what really separate him  especially for a 6-foot-4 receiver. Although he isn't as physically imposing as Julio Jones, there are several similarities between the two, including the way they play strong to the football.

Fast forward to the present, and the Michigan State transfer isn't a secret any longer. With his size/speed athleticism and acrobatic ball skills, Coleman (38 catches for 538 yards and nine TDs) is a freakish talent with the chance to be a dominant player. His flashes remind me of how Demaryius Thomas played when he was at Georgia Tech.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;OL

**5. LT Olu Fashanu 6-6 321** \- At 6 feet 6 and 321 pounds with 34 3/8-inch arms, Fashanu is one of the best pass-protecting tackle prospects in recent years. He shows an outstanding blend of size, movement skills and body control to easily access his anchor. His intelligence and character are also strong selling points. Scouts want to see a more aggressive approach from him, especially in the run game.

**6. LT Joe Alt 6-7 322** \- Alt already was clearly a first-round prospect based on his sophomore film, but he looks even better as a junior  it won't be a surprise if he finishes as OT1 for some NFL teams. For a tall blocker (nearly 6 feet 8), he does a terrific job with his redirect and recovery, and you'll rarely see him stressed. Even though he didn't become a full-time offensive lineman until college, Alt plays with impressive technique and pad level.

**10. RT JC Latham 6-6 335** \- A massive blocker, Latham carries his weight well in pass protection and plays with exceptional strength from head to toe. In the run game, he creates movement at contact and specializes in dumping linebackers at the second level. He needs to be more consistent with his strike placement and protecting versus inside moves, but Latham has quickly and consistently improved since he arrived in Tuscaloosa. He has the goods to be a starting NFL right tackle next year.

**19. RT Amarius Mims 6-7 330** \- The No. 5 player in my preseason top 50, Mims looked primed for a breakout season, but he has been sidelined with an ankle injury. Nonetheless, I'm still captivated by his flashes and traits. He moves tremendously well for a 330-pounder and packs a punch behind his powerful hands. With just five career starts to his name, Mims needs to establish his body of work, but I'll bet on his baseline talent.

**22. LT Tyler Guyton 6-6 319** \- Similar to Amarius Mims, Guyton's draft projection is based more on traits and upside than body of work, which can make it challenging to accurately rank him at this point. But he offers the big-man athleticism and movement skills that make it easy to be optimistic for his future. Several NFL scouts believe his potential is greater than that of Anton Harrison, a 2023 first-rounder from Oklahoma.

**29. LT Jordan Morgan 6-5 306** \- If not for a late-season injury, Morgan could have been a top-50 pick in the 2023 draft. Instead, the left tackle returned to Arizona for his fifth season and is now playing his best football. Morgan stays balanced in his pass sets and leverages his body and massive hands to answer pass rushers. Some NFL teams want to keep him outside; others are grading him as a guard.

**33. iOL Troy Fautanu 6-4 319** \- A college left tackle, Fautanu has the talent and length to stay outside, but his body and play style suggest that an NFL move to guard could be what is best long-term. Fautanu has NFL-level feet and movements, and he is playing with better composure and committing fewer penalties than last season.

**49. iOL Graham Barton 6-5 311** \- A college left tackle, Barton most likely will move inside to guard or center in the NFL. Either way, he projects as a long-term starter. He is athletic, keeps his blocks centered and finishes with a stubborn grip. Regardless of the position he plays, there are a lot of NFL teams that could use his skill set right now.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EDGE

**7. Dallas Turner 6-4 242** \- When it comes to rushing the passer, Turner checks the boxes for both traits and production. He is explosive off the ball and into contact, and he plays with exceptional pursuit speed to chase down the football. Turner is currently the only FBS player ranked top five nationally in sacks (7.0), pressures, pass-rush win rate and pass-rush win percentage.

**9. Laiatu Latu 6-5 265** \- Similar to 2021 first-round pick Jaelen Phillips (both in terms of skill level and personal journey), Latu is an interesting prospect. He plays with only average bend, his arms aren't very long and his medical history is a potential concern. But his motor runs hot, and he has a graduate degree in rush technique  specializing in cross-chops, arm-overs and lightning-fast hands. Latu has accounted for a ridiculous 106 pressures in 21 games since he transferred to UCLA prior to last season.

**12. Chop Robinson 6-3 250** \- For Robinson (5.0 tackles for loss, 3.0 sacks) to be ranked this highly, it'd be great if he was more consistently dominant. But he'll go on heaters (see: the Iowa tape), where he'll just take over games for stretches with his instant speed and aggressive hands. He is a better prospect than Will McDonald IV, who was drafted No. 15 this past April. Robinson exited the Ohio State game last Saturday with an injury and had to be carted to the locker room, but Penn State hopes to get him back soon.

**15. Jared Verse 6-4 260** \- A fast and physical edge defender, Verse passed up a potential spot in last year's first round for one more year in college, and he has helped the Seminoles jump out to an 8-0 start. Verse (6.5 TFL, 4.5 sacks) hasn't had the splashy impact most expected  he's failed to record a sack in five of eight games so far  but he still looks like the same player from the 2022 tape, which isn't a bad thing.

**23. J.T. Tuimoloau 6-4 270** \- A physical presence for all four quarters, Tuimoloau (5.0 tackles for loss, 4.0 sacks) wins the point of attack with aggressive hands and by using body leverage to pry open pass-rush lanes. He needs to work on becoming more deceptive (like he was on his fake stunt against Olu Fashanu) to consistently beat NFL tackles, but his baseline traits make him a next-level starter.

**36. Jack Sawyer 6-4 265 -** While J.T. Tuimoloau receives most of the attention on the Ohio State defensive line, Sawyer's impact has been instrumental to the Buckeyes' success. Built the right way at 6 feet 4 and 265 pounds, Sawyer (26 tackles, 2.0 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks) is more good than great in several categories. He is well-rounded, though, and could be a valuable piece to an NFL defensive line with his aggressive and always-alert play style versus both run and pass.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;CB

**14. CB Nate Wiggins 6-2 185** \- Wiggins is long and fast with the sudden feet to easily redirect and stay attached to routes. There are a few concerning areas of his game, most notably his marginal play strength, but Wiggins (one INT, four passes defended) shows a knack for playing through the hands of receivers. Though he gave up a touchdown in his return from injury against Miami on Oct. 21, he also had a pair of pass breakups and an impressive chase-down forced fumble.

**17. CB Cooper DeJean 6-1 207** \- With his athletic traits, toughness and versatility, DeJean (two INTs, three passes defended, one punt-return TD) checks a lot of boxes, regardless of scheme. He is arguably the best run-defending defensive back in college football and plays sticky in coverage. DeJean also offers value on special teams  his dramatic punt return against Minnesota may have been nullified, but it's still on tape and added to his collection of splash plays as a returner and gunner.

**18. CB Kool-Aid McKinstry 6-1 195** \- With his body control and balance, McKinstry (21 career passes defended) stays controlled in his transitions and takes advantage of his length to obstruct passing windows. Though he doesn't play panicked, he tends to hit cruise control at times and gets too conservative, which can lead to missed tackles or plays downfield. But there are still more positives than negatives to his game, and he projects as an immediate NFL starter.

**26. CB Kalen King 5-11 191** \- There's no way around it: King had a disappointing performance versus Ohio State, his most important tape of the season. Whether in the slot or outside, Marvin Harrison Jr. had little trouble creating separation against him, and King also committed two costly penalties (one took points off the board for Penn State; another set up Ohio State near the goal line). King (25 career passes defended) is a talented and aggressive competitor and still belongs in the first-round discussion, but he must finish the season strong  including an important matchup against Michigan on Nov. 11.",CHIBears,35,20,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17lfz5z/the_athletic_dane_brugler_nfl_draft_2024_big/,football,NA

2) And this is more to the point: Is Sweat really the type of player Flus is looking for? Based on a few podcasts I listen to, Flus has never been real big on really truly going after the QB. More of a ""pressure him and hope he fucks up or something"".

With that in mind, does Sweat sound like a player Poles is going to spend a 2^nd rounder knowing he'll need to get a serious payday soon if he doesn't think the HC is going to take full advantage? Or does he sound like a player that will make this a more attractive team for the *next* HC who he knows is coming soon?

2023-11-01,1698847161,Regarding Poles,"Why don't we go through the major arguments shall we?

COACHING: Eberlose was hired 2 days after Poles became GM. That speaks to a flawed hiring process that didn't let Poles pick his guy. My guess is George came in and said you can hire any one of these 3 guys. Poles should be able to pick his guy to run the team whether it's Ben Johnson or Ejiro Evero or Ken Dorsey or whoever. 

FREE AGENCY/CONTRACTS: Obviously this is a salient topic because JJ asked for a trade, but honestly, I don't think it's the wrong decision if JJ was asking for way too much. Roquan was never coming back. You can't trash the GM and expect to stay. The Kmet extension was smart and made a ton of sense. Tremaine and TJ have performed decently for what we paid them and Andrew Billings has been sneaky good. 

TRADES: Much too early to judge the most recent deal, but he's hit both ends of the spectrum. The trade from the #1 pick was a hit, obviously the Claypool trade was a massive L. But in the moment, the Claypool trade made a bunch of sense, and I'm guessing a lot of people on this sub would've killed Poles for not getting any help for JF1. 

DRAFT CLASSES: In Poles first class, he took among others Kyler Gordon(who's developing nicely), Jaquan Brisker(who's pretty good), Braxton Jones(who could be a Charles Leno analogue), and Elijah Hicks(who's been a good depth piece akin to DHC)

This past class could be even better. Darnell Wright has looked really good, Gervon Dexter has been highly rated, Roschon Johnson runs like he's angry at the grass, and Stevenson, Pickens, Scott, and Terrell Smith have shown flashes. 

In conclusion, Poles shouldn't be fired; he should be given more time. Two years isn't enough to fix this dumpster fire. But he's helped build a new foundation.

This was obvious to anyone that looked at Fields' drop back from year 1 to year 3 and how it has slowed down, and the aggressiveness reduced. It's the effect of having a defensive head coach that, as Bagent puts it, never turn the ball over is the first and final commandment. It's what happens when you have an OC that rode Aaron Rodgers and thinks lining up Tyler Scott at fullback and trying to have him block as a fullback is a great idea. 

Sad that it took 2 QBs for this to be noticed. Regardless of what the Bears do this offseason the most important move is to fire this coaching staff.",CHIBears,246,561,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17qkp8i/robert_schmitz_theres_something_wrong_with_the/,football,NA

2023-11-08,1699430357,Breaking down the types of copes for not drafting a qb with our first pick.,"**Hopium**: The idea that the fields evaluation isn't over, and he still has a chance to come back and prove himself. While this may technically be true, the body of work strongly suggests that fields will *not* come back in a mythicised, mvp form. There is, in fact, no reason to believe it will be true, and 6 good quarters as a passer is not enough evidence to bolster this notion as anything more than fantasy. Especially when they were followed up by the exact same output of fields we had all come to know, capped off with a very sad injury that ultimately arose from holding the ball for too long. This cope for not drafting a quarterback denies that the quarterback position is even a problem for the team, and is rooted in an emotional attachment to Justin Fields, for reasons like ""he is a good guy"" and the college team he played for. (Or even further, that the quarterback is so interrelated to the team and therefore the fan's identity, that they will never assign them earnest fault, instead opting to throw under the bus nameless, faceless players and position groups they have no attachment to, or coaches they also have no attachment to.) The hopium belief, that if fields turns into a consistent, top 10 starter, who we can then hold on to, is appealing because it provides us the most optimism heading in to the future, and we can allocate more draft capital into strengthening valuable positions. Its fallacy is that we are already playing with a hypothetical, and fields affords us hardly any more certainty than a draft pick. 

**QB erasure**: the idea that the quarterback actually isn't *that* important, that the bears should sink capital into positions that are easier to draft, and simply sign an available free agent to be a bridge quarterback a year. These fans advocate for building up our roster to where we win enough games we will not be able to draft a high-end prospect without trading up- when we actually need one, because we are not winning anything important with a stopgap qb. (This is also known as putting the cart before the horse). The majority of these fans are out on fields, but probably on the older side, and undervalue the importance of the quarterback position. They believe that sitting Bo Nix behind Gardner Minshew is the key to success. The problem with this model is that you take your franchise qb out of sync with the team around him, racing to fill a hole with the hardest position in professional sports as your championship window closes as your roster ages and you can't afford new contracts. The hole that you could have filled in 2024, but you decided to build the team backwards. ""But u/reverieontheonyx, getting our franchise qb and building up our roster can be done concurrently, we can just take a flier and let him sit and learn."" Yes, it can. But your chances of drafting a franchise qb drop the more of them you pass on. What fuels this thought is survivorship bias from guys like dak prescott, who showed out as day 3 picks, that ignores the hundreds of low-capital investments who amounted to nothing who you have forgotten about or never heard of. You are taking the true observation, ""the first quarterback taken isn't even the best in the draft most of the time"", and taking it to mean ""we should not take the first quarterback"", instead of understanding ""while the first quarterback taken is usually not the best of their class, it *is* the draft position *most likely* to render the best quarterback of its class."" The fallacy stems from holding the first taken against the 11 after it, and so of course among the *sum* 11 there is a greater likelihood of ""the guy"" being there- but #1 is *still* the best odds of any one draft position. This is kind of a monty hall problem. 

""But what about brady and stafford who got dropped into contending teams and immediately won superbowls?""

1.) What about Aaron Rodgers and Russel Wilson who didn't?

2.) Both of those teams were led by first overall pick qbs beforehand, who were able to stabilise the position while the roster was built into a contender. Worse picks are less likely to be able to do even that. Stafford was also a first overall pick. 

**The cursed franchise**: The belief that the bears franchise is uniquely poorly run, and that no quarterback can succeed here due to factors outside of the quarterback's control. The evidence for this belief includes the fact that justin fields and mitch trubisky didn't succeed here, or that we have been poverty for the last decade, or that we have yet to have a 4,000 yard passer. This belief stems from main character syndrome, a misunderstanding of the probability that a quarterback is a bust, and a false cause of what actually makes a franchise poverty. There is nothing unusual about two quarterbacks busting- one of whom had only year as the starter in college after losing the qb competition to a nobody, and the other who was the fourth quarterback selected of his respective draft. These fans are the cynical counterpart to the Hopium contingent, who believes that fields cannot fail, only be failed, and may extend this to mitchell trubisky (who has apparently been failed by the steelers as well.) Their faith in the team has been rattled by losses that can only be explained by the malpractice of the old woman who owns the team and defers responsibilities to everyone else- once she passes, things may be different. Because as we know, it's not the players on the field that matters, it's about the billionaire whose hands the franchise is in. While true that some owners are better than others, and they do hire managers who hire coaches and draft players, and the mccaskeys aren't particularly good ones, this is *not* a reason to not invest in the quarterback position. (The same but even more can be said for the 4,000 yard passer factual- which btw, was true of the eagles as well.... until they drafted a qb...) Franchises are jokes until they aren't when they draft a franchise qb. Bad qbs get their coaches fired. Good ones keep their coaches employed. These fans call for the entire roster to be gutted, coaches fired, management canned- but curiously, the qb can stay. These fans, like the QB Erasure contingent, devalue the role of the quarterback position, believing our roster to be bereft of talent, and can be seen saying things like ""even prime brady couldn't succeed with these coaches"", or patrick mahomes with this oline, or caleb williams with ""these pieces around him."" They must not have been watching our current 2-7 season where several games were singlehandedly sabotaged with poor qb play, and we would have a winning record right now with better. 

""Our coaches don't even call plays to the quarterback's strengths!"" 

What plays can you call for a QB who can't read a defence or get the ball out quickly enough to hot routes? More rollouts and designed runs? I thought he was supposed to take a leap as a passer this season. 

""The lions had a franchise qb and they were a joke.""

Yeah, but they were also better than us in that timeframe, stafford inherited an 0-16 roster, and he was leveraged in a trade for a haul. Plus if any franchise can claim being uniquely cursed, they have more of a right to it than we do. 

-


**So what does all of this mean?** It means that fans who are arguing against using a high draft pick on a qb to replace our current bust qb are in denial about the bust qb we have now, the importance of the qb position, or that top tier prospects are more likely to turn into top tier nfl qbs. They may be making a logical error, or they may be unprepared to take the risk of drafting a quarterback high, because expectations open the possibility for disappointment. It will happen regardless, and it is our best chance of escaping the basement.",CHIBears,66,0,0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17qgu4z/breaking_down_the_types_of_copes_for_not_drafting/,football,NA
2023-11-08,1699427027,Is it just me or is anybody else not excited by any of the QB prospects in this upcoming draft?,"To preface this post, this has nothing to do with Fields. Whether he is or (more likely) isn't the guy going into next season doesn't have any affect on my views on this QB class.

But anyway yea, nothing gets me excited about these upcoming QBs like previous classes. Williams has great mechanics and can make off-platform throws, but he plays too much hero ball and his performances against top 25 defenses is suspect at best. Not to mention all accounts point to him being a diva, which isn't ideal for a good locker room. Maye on the other hand does just as well with less talent surrounding him and is still very technically sound; but he also hasn't performed well against any top competition (actually statistically worse than Williams).

Penix has looked amazing so far but still has a lot of season yet to play, the same goes for JJ McCarthy. I don't even want to discuss Bo Nix as his play style doesn't really gel with an NFL offense and looks to be a product of a great college system.

I understand why it's rare, but it's surprising to me that coaches virtually never let their contract expire and go to free agency.

2023-11-07,1699332919,"Incoming shitpost, beware.","Just sittin' here thinking about the off-season and this is what I would like to see play out&.

As it stands we currently we own the #2 and #3 picks but that will probably not change much. Arizona with Kyler back will win anywhere between 4-6 games by season's end, however the Giants might leapfrog to #1 overall when the season is done. With the Daniel Jones contract they are stuck with, they won't go QB, Marvin Harrison Jr. now becomes an option for them.

Carolina will play a bit better ending with 4 wins, knocking us out for the #1. The Bears win 3 more on the way out to bring us to 5-12. The Patriots look bad but will win a few more to also reach 5-12. We will, I guess, lose the tiebreaker for the worse of the 2 selections and when it's said and done, this is what I see as the finished draft order&.

1. New York Giants

2. Chicago (via Carolina)

3. New England

4. Chicago 

5. Arizona

Now, New England is a dark horse to go QB especially if there is a regime change and Belicheck is let go. However, I see Las Vegas as another team that would be looking QB so we hold the golden ticket at #2. I think Chicago holds on to #4 but trades out of #2 to either New England or Vegas, bigger haul wins. In terms of roster players that are enticing enough to put into a package with draft packs, Christian Barmore - DT with the Patriots looks the most intriguing. 

New England is sold on Caleb Williams and offers Barmore, #3, and a 2025 1st for #2. 

Las Vegas panics and wants Drake Maye before the Bears consider taking him as heir to Fields. Vegas then offers #10 (my projected draft selection for them), 2024 2nd, 2025 1st, and a 2026 2nd for the recently acquired #3.

Bears select OT - Olu Fashanu at #4

Bears select WR - Keon Coleman at #10

After all is said and done the Bears leave the 2024 Draft with Fashanu, Coleman, Christian Barmore, 2 2025 1st Rounders, a 2024 2nd Rounder, and a 2026 2nd Rounder.

Fields gets one more shot to be the guy with a plethora of draft captial and a shiny new young DT from New England to pair with Billings/Dexter/Picckens.",CHIBears,28,0,0.15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17pmrht/incoming_shitpost_beware/,football,NA
2023-11-07,1699332331,Ryan Poles doesn't have a plan or vision,"This man makes questionable move after questionable move that blows up in his face but it's always written off as ""King Poles has a plan."" There are plenty of moves he's made that are bad but I'll focus on the moves that he made that show he has no plan or vision. Too many moves he's made seem to contradict one another and shows a very clear lack of planning. 

2022 NFL draft: George Pickens is on the board and Poles passes him over for a below average slot corner in Kyler Gordon and an average at best box safety in brisker. This is while Pickens is on the board when we had a dire need at wide receiver with a talented second year QB. Ok fine, you want to go BPA, we'll give you the benefit of the doubt. What does he do in round 3? Reaches for a 25 year old with nothing but straight-line speed in VJJ because he realized he did absolutely fucking nothing to help his young QB in FA or the draft. He panics, reaches for an offensive guy and lights a very valuable third round pick on fire. 

2022 trade deadline: He decides to jettison roquan smith because he had an arbitrary value in his head for how much he was worth and wouldn't budge on it. Fine, we'll give that to you. Then he goes and gets into a bidding war with FTP over CHASE CLAYPOOL, a receiver on a downward trend who isn't even half the player Roquan is, going from having to give up the ravens 2nd to his own. So much for having a valuation in mind that he was sticking to. The cherry on top is that this was a clear panic move, he did nothing to help Fields in the offseason and the moment he showed any kind of talent he freaked out and overpaid for a complete bum. 

2023 offseason: Doesn't sign any big ticket FAs, signs a bunch of bargain bin guys because only king poles knows the true value of a player and isn't willing to pay a cent more than the arbitrary number he's established. This is despite a stud OT in Orlando Brown Jr sitting right there and we had oodles of cap room which was one of the few good things Poles has done. This leads to us on the clock at 9 and who else but Jalen Carter, the guy who was supposed to go in the top 3 falls to us. But Poles has backed himself into a corner and HAS to pick a tackle to support his promising QB. Which leads to us taking Darnell Wright. To be clear, it has looked like a good pick so far, but the chance he's that much better than orlando brown jr seems low who would've only cost money, instead of the chance to draft a generational talent on the defensive line. 

Montez Sweat trade: Poles doesn't go all in on this season, which many were clamoring for him to do because he thought this team wasn't ready to compete yet which proved to be 100% correct and probably deserves more credit for that than he should. That's all good. So when we start 2-6, seems like this scenario of us being complete shit has come true for him. So why is he trading at the minimum a top 40 pick for a 27 year old edge rusher? He had the idea that this team isn't ready to compete, but then trades for a position that tends to decline very fast once they hit 29/30? Absolute best case scenario is that this team is ready to compete in year 2 of the rookie we draft next year, in 2025. Sweat will be 29 years old by then and will probably start his decline. It's not just the money, yes that pick might not be as good as him, but peak montez sweat will be on a last place team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Number one pick trade: This isn't a bad move, but I'm sick of people saying it's some fleece by Poles. He extracted fair value for the number one pick given he was moving all the way down to 9. Diggs and AJB got first rounders, DJ Moore is probably worth a little less but for the sake of argument lets say he's a first. Poles got 2 seconds and 2 firsts to move from 1 to 9, which is nice, but fair value for that steep of a drop given past history. This does look good now because of their pick next year, but if they took stroud over young they'd probably have a winning record, nothing Poles forsaw there.

&amp;#x200B;

It was time for Ryan Pace to go but at least he had a plan and went after what he wanted. He took this franchise from dumpster fire/joke level to purgatory. Poles took us from there right back to being the joke of the league and we seemed poised to replace the Lions",CHIBears,1,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17pmm12/ryan_poles_doesnt_have_a_plan_or_vision/,football,NA

We, as a fanbase, should not be entertaining this. We're engaged emotionally in a competition that does not exist, and that neither QB asked for.

The media is playing right into this shit too, and fans  both casual and highly invested  are eating it up.

Whether either QB is the guy, neither deserves to be at the center of this bullshit. Despite what Fields and Bagent are or are not at QB, they both are seemingly good people, yet are being pitted against each other. The revisionist history by the media two weeks in a row regarding Fields is just odd, while analysts have been overly quick to prop up Bagent as the missing piece to this dumpster fire of a team and organization.

Regardless, I'm just tired. I don't know what the issue is with Fields, or Bagent, but what is clear to me is that this organization hasn't had its team on the same page since 1992. Literally my entire life, it's always been something with this team. I'm tired of watching potential wasted, consistently, year in and year out.

Y'all can debate who is and isn't the guy based on the flavor-of-the-week stats that pop up. I want to know why this organization has consistently failed to identify, draft, and develop talent at the most important position in the NFL for 30 years.

Look at the postgame of the Michigan-Penn State match up. These coaches and players are choking up on the verge of tears just talking about him, they love the man. This Michigan team would run through multiple brick walls for him. 

This was supposed to be an exciting season in Chicago where we see this team take the next step and some of this new talent come into themselves.

Eberflus can talk about HITS to the press til he's blue in the face but nobody in the locker room seems bought into anything about this coaching regime. 

Harbaugh is the type of coach to set a direction for a rudderless ship. If it were any other big name college coach I'd be more wary but he's been to the Super Bowl, he's no stranger to the league.

The Giants with Saquon, a worse receiving unit, way worse OL that got Daniel Jones killed, decent coach and about 47mil in cap space.

The Patriots with a bunch of WR3s, Mike Gesicki (mid), Rhamondre Stevenson (Herbert better), one of the worst OLs in the league.

1. He's shown he can develop a QB. He's been Jalen Hurst's QB coach since 2020. On top of that he was Kyle Trask's OC and QB coach the year he finished 4th as a Heisman Trophy finalist.

2. Like Ben Johnson, he has play calling experience. 

2. He has the highest scoring offense by any team in the NFL who's head coach doesn't call plays, good for second highest scoring offense overall behind only Miami. 

3. He has the 2nd best yardage of any offense in the NFL not called by their head coach, trailing only Ben Johnson. This is good for the 3rd highest yardage offense overall in the NFL, trailing the aforementioned Lions and of course the Dolphins.

4. Coming from the Eagles, he'll have some great connections to build the staff on defense. An example of how this will be useful is the Texans; they hired a great defensive guy from the 49ers in Demeco Ryans, who also brought over a great OC with him from the 49ers. Having connections like this is an underrated part of a HC hire and Ben Johnson will have them.

2023-11-10,1699637529,2024 Draft Picks - Michael Penix Jr. with the second first rounder,"Hey everyone,

So, I've been wondering about what the Bears could potentially do to solve their issue at QB. While I don't think Justin Fields is horrible, I don't see him as a long-term starter in the NFL either. At least not in a traditional NFL offense, maybe more in the role of a Taysom Hill.

&amp;#x200B;

If we do get the first or second overall pick in the 2024 draft, I think we will most definitely select one of Caleb Williams or Drake Maye. Let's say we dont, Carolina wins 3 or 4 games, we do too and we end up with picks #4 and #10 or something similar. We should probably target Marvin Harrison Jr. with our first pick, but could the second be used on a QB like Michael Penix Jr.? He's having a fantastic season, one of the frontrunners for the Heisman, he's accurate, has an NFL arm and could probably be molded into a solid pocket passer in most NFL schemes. The injuries are a concern, so I wouldn't draft him SUPER high, but what's your opinion on it?

OL is playing well, defense playing well and instantly improved by Sweat. Moore is still the best player on the team, Kmet, Mooney, Foreman, Herbert coming back, great opportunity for Fields to show if he can be the guy we thought he could (and show consistency) before the franchise moves on.

Admittedly I've been very reluctant to give up on fields, I just see so much potential fucked up by (imo) coaching and play calling. But I will move on if he gets to prove me wrong through the rest of the season& or he can prove me right and we can ball out on other positional needs and make our run!

This is the first year there's more 75+ pass rushers than 75+ pass blockers. 

So after looking into the rules changes before the 2019 season, I'm convinced the elimination of blindside blocks within the pocket was what spurred the large drop from 2018 to 2019. I think IOL still probably got away with it a bit in 2019, but by 2020, no one was doing it anymore, and the pass blocking of IOL dropped as a result. This also explains why pass blocking by tackles was stable and consistent from 2018 to 2019 as tackles rarely had the opportunity/need to execute blindside blocks. I am not sure what has caused the further deterioration of interior line pass blocking from 2022 to this season, but by percentage, it is the biggest single year drop in the years I looked at. I'm inclined to believe that the drop-off in tackle pass blocking this year is due to the severe drop off in IOL pass blocking.

Does anyone have any theories on what is behind the drop in IOL pass blocking this year? I don't think there were any significant changes in rules this off-season that would impact pass blocking, but maybe I missed something.

I included the amount of pass rushers with a rating of 75+ in pass rushing to show that there was a gap up in 2019 likely due to the blindside block rule, but besides that, it has remained stable and is not up this year despite  offensive lines being lower rated this year.

TL:DR trying to figure out why offensive lines are so shitty nowadays and dug through PFF data and found out that it's specifically IOL pass blocking that's in the gutter and the decline started in 2019 due to the elimination of blindside blocks.",CHIBears,102,44,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17r9aqh/noticed_an_interesting_trend_on_pff_concerning/,football,NA

2023-11-15,1700064938,I think there's a real chance Eberflus isn't fired this year and I could see it being a good decision.,"Hot take alert I know

But there's a big difference between what he's done versus what guys like Nagy, Trestman, and others have: his side of the ball is playing well.

Nagy and Trestman were offensive background coaches who could not field competent offenses. While there is a lot of scrutiny of the Bears offense this year, the defense has turned it around lately after getting healthy and certain players stepping up.

If this defense finishes the year as a top 15 or 10 unit, wouldn't it be counter productive to clean the entire house? Continuity on the defensive side of the ball and in the building may be what's best for this team instead of another complete tear down. Players like Kyler Gordon, Jaquan Brisker, Dexter, Edwards, and others fit this scheme and are becoming comfortable in it and experienced in it. Bringing in a new coaching staff and scheme potentially means scheming some of these players out and starting from square one on developing and building a defense. 

I see every reason to move on from Getsy and the current offense. And with a potential top QB available with the draft starting fresh on that side could be what's best for the team. But that doesn't have to include the D and Eberflus too.

I think the way the D plays the rest of the year is going to be the biggest determining factor in whether or not Eberflus is retained. We've also seen CJ Stroud succeed with a defensive minded head coach too so the old narrative that a young QB needs to be married to a young offensive minded HC isn't necessary. Guys like Eric Bienemy may even be available to OC this off-season if Washington cleans house. 

I'm not here to be a an apologist for Eberflus. He has had bad moments and should be on the hot seat. If his defense can't keep it together the last half of the season then by all means he should be gone. But I also don't wanna see the Bears come to some unnecessary conclusion that we have to tear everything down again and start from the beginning when their could potentially be ways to compete sooner.",CHIBears,96,0,0.41,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17vx3hx/i_think_theres_a_real_chance_eberflus_isnt_fired/,football,NA

&amp;#x200B;

Inspired by a prior post comparing Orton and Justin, thought it interesting that Justin has now has 31 starts (33 total games) which is how many Jay had through his first 2 seasons with us. Most folks here would probably assume Jay was a better passer/QB, and he does have a slightly higher completion percentage (60.5 vs. 60.1) and significantly more yards (not surprising since total yards are mostly a function of volume/attempts). But interestingly Justin has the higher yards/attempt, passer rating, and TD/INT ratio (1.30 vs. 1.19). This comparison should also favor Jay more since these were his 4th/5th seasons in the NFL, ages 26 and 27, whereas these are Justin's first 3 years, ages 22-24. Justin has way more sacks (87 to 115, 8.1% to 13.3% rate) and fumbles (19 to 32) which isn't surprising given the criticism of holding the ball too long. Also not surprising is Justin's massive advantage on the ground, but some may be surprised that, per pass attempt, he has been the more efficient passer despite being earlier into his career. However, his issues holding the ball/taking sacks/being susceptible to fumbles are even worse and hold him back even more than I would have thought.",CHIBears,47,0,0.28,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17vb6vc/jay_cutler_vs_justin_fields_through_31_first/,football,NA

2023-11-14,1699986859,Passing Stats for Kyle Orton Vs Justin Fields at 33 Games: Some Interesting Stuff!,"Out of curiosity I pulled up the complete stats for all Chicago Bears passers on [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/career-passing.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/career-passing.htm).  I was interested in seeing how Justin Fields W-L ratio stacked up to other QBs, however when I selected yardage as the criteria to sort out the QBs I was genuinely surprised to see how closely Kyle Orton and Justin Fields stack up in terms of their passing stats for the same number of games played with the club.  Both currently sit at a total of 33 games, however their total passing yardage is nearly identical:

At 33 games:

Kyle Orton: 5319 yards

Justin Fields: 5313 yards

Fields has a higher completion percentage (60.1%), however one could argue that is because he often runs the ball out of bounds rather than throwing it away when under pressure.  Fields also has a higher TD %, but also a higher INT %.  Otherwise, it's strange to see how closely their passing stats match even though Orton was seen as a stopgap QB at best in an era where we had a strong defense and Fields has been promoted (at least in the past) as a 'generational' QB by his fans and the club.

It's also interesting to look at overall QB W-L records.  Fields obviously has one of the worst W-L records in team history (and it looks like the absolute worst with over 20 starts, as his percentage is down there with Cade McNown, who had fewer starts), but I was honestly surprised to see that Grossman's W-L record was nowhere near what I somehow remembered it being.

My takeaway is this, as someone who is tired of all the excuses for Fields and is becoming motivated to post here by all the 'ride or die with Fields' mentality: I don't believe Fields is the future and think his stans are not paying attention, however he is about equal as a passer to all the mediocre QBs that we eventually moved away from in the 2000s.  His passing stats, based on this chart, basically fall within the Orton-Grossman-Miller range of the 2000s.  These were QBs who had some good moments, but they were all guys the Bears moved on from after they got past 30 games.  Cutler's stats are significantly better and I feel guilty for bashing on the guy back in the day:

This is the Lions fourth game against a team with a top 10 run defense. First game against a team in the top 3. Those games were:

W vs. Chiefs [#10 RSH DEF] - KC allowed 118 rushing yards (74 yds and 1TD to Monty)

W vs. Bucs [#7] - TB allowed 40 rushing yards (14 yds to Monty)

W vs. Chargers [#9] - LA allowed 200 rushing yards (116 yds and 1TD to Monty)

The Bears currently hold the second best defense against the run, allowing 3.2 YPC on average, and I think we will stuff the Lions run game and Monty.

That being said, Monty will still probably get a TD, Lions win, with Goff murdering us through the air. But ay >7B",CHIBears,75,65,0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17v6rgy/regarding_those_who_say_monty_will_destroy_us/,football,NA

But, if we are to fire Eberflus and go with an offensively minded guy we need to get a great defensive coordinator to ensure our defense performs.

2019 49ers with Shanahan and Saleh
Bengals with Taylor and Anarumo
Chiefs with Reid and Spagnola 

Saleh likely won't be fired but I can see a reason for him to be fired. He picked Zach Wilson, and I've seen reports of the team thinking he's a Zach Wilson apologist and that they're fed up with it. Idk the truth of it but he could be on the hot seat although unlikely. Especially if they keep losing. 

But, he has built great defenses under his command, such as the 49ers and Jets current defenses, he did most of the work on it considering both teams had bad defenses before he came over.

He's a young guy as far as head coaches go - just 36. Prior to taking control of the Texans' offense, he got his start in coaching as a defensive assistant under Mike Shanahan in Washington. From there, he worked for Kyle Shanahan also as a defensive assistant until 2019, when he shifted to the offensive side. 

We all know the Shanahan tree is SO HOT right now, so take that for what it is. He's been around DeMeco Ryans, who is showing he knows how to build one hell of a culture, for a number of years. CJ Stroud's ascension should have all teams with QB troubles foaming at the mouth as well.

2023-11-13,1699893558,Quotes/excerpts from Adam Jahn's scouting report on North Carolina QB Drake Maye (vs Duke),"# General Info/Positives:

* **Every scout asked about Maye gave a thumbs-up on his character**.
   * During the game, Maye often engaged with his teammates and Tar Heels assistant coaches.
      * **Jahns -** *He celebrated touchdowns with everyone. But he's not a rah-rah leader. You didn't see that before or during the game.* 
      * **If you're looking for a stoic, even-keeled quarterback, then Maye is your pick.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Scouts see Maye's athletic family as a plus and an advantage.**
   * *He has all the physical traits,* a scouting executive said. Listed at 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, Maye fits the profile that teams look for in quarterbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

* **His arm talent is apparent.**
   * **Jahns -** Every evaluator mentioned it. Maye showed it off during warmups and throughout the game. Some of his strongest throws looked effortless.
      * *He has all the physical tools,* a scout for an AFC team said before the game. *He can make all the throws.*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Maye delivered in the clutch. Again, again, again and again**.
   * An AFC team executive, who wasn't in attendance against Duke, said weeks ago that he had Maye rated better than Williams. **Several reasons were later provided. It started with accuracy and ball placement. Another was being clutch.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **When scrambling, Maye will keep his eyes downfield.**
   * *I was trying to keep my head up,* Maye said. *I feel like that's one of my best attributes. Never put my head down and just taking a sack, taking a tackle. I try to keep my head up and throw it if I'm getting tackled.""*

# From his Teammates:

* *Drake means a lot to this team,* DE Kaimon Rucker said. *Drake, he's not that vocal but vocal when he needs to be.""*
   * **Steady through highs and lows:**
      * *""And I feel like that's one of his best traits, is that he has unwavering confidence no matter what the game is looking like, no matter what the stats look like, no matter what the performance is looking like.""*
* The Tar Heels have a playmaker.
   * *******It's almost natural for Drake to make big plays,******* TE Nesbit said. ***And when you have that, that rubs off on all of us as well.***

&amp;#x200B;

# Possible Concerns:

* **Some scouts have concerns about how Maye processes the field.**
   * He threw an awful interception out of his own end zone in the first half.
   * Maye struggled in the red zone through the first three quarters.

&amp;#x200B;

**Transition to NFL -**

* *These young QBs don't have much time to prove their mettle once they're in the NFL,* said a scout for an AFC team, who wasn't in attendance. ***The more experience in college these guys have at huddling up, verbally calling a play, audibling at the line of scrimmage and ID'ing the Mike (linebacker), the better.***
   * *If you don't have any experience doing any of those things,* ***it doesn't mean you can't learn, but the learning curve is a lot steeper***,**** the scout said.
      * Jahn's noted the new OC for the Tar Heels rarely huddles and are often in shotgun - So much so, that reporters in the press box call out when they're under center.",CHIBears,34,40,0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17uenzl/quotesexcerpts_from_adam_jahns_scouting_report_on/,football,NA

2023-11-13,1699886090,Project QBs,"Who are the ""project"" QBs in the upcoming draft?  I know that it changes dramatically from now until the draft and people will shoot up or down teams' draft boards, but I'd like a few names to keep an eye out for.  I don't follow college football much so I only know the very hyped and common names (Williams, Maye).

I'd love for the Bears to be able to pick up their version of Russel Wilson, Kirk Cousins, Jalen Hurts, Lamar Jackson, Mahomes etc: guys who were picked up initially not to start immediately.  Ideally they'd be a late 1st so that we have a 5th year option on them.  

This would be the scenario for me: we get picks #3 and 6 or so.  We draft MHJ with #3. We trade #6 to get a pick in the mid teens and a few more picks.  We draft a QB in the late teens or even 2nd and 3rd to develop.  We let the kid sit for a year behind Fields. I think we can be an average team at the very least with Fields (now that our O line and defense are coming together).  Fields has lost a lot, but he has also shown many games where he has put up 27+ points.  If our defense can consistently hold teams to 27 or less, we will win our fair share of games.

I'm tired of throwing young QBs into a dumpster fire and expecting them to make magic out of nothing.  A QB project would give Fields some competition and we can keep him on a fairly short leash.  Who knows, the rookie could even beat him out in training camp.  I just don't want all the pressure to be on the rookie to perform immediately.

Alternatively obviously we can just draft a QB as high as possible and get rid of Fields.  The turnaround by the Texans has been amazing to watch.  They went from near last in the league to playoff contenders by drafting a rookie QB and changing the coaching staff.  We are set up in much the same way.  I just think that is a much riskier route to take and I'd rather build everything else first.",CHIBears,59,0,0.3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17ubydj/project_qbs/,football,NA

Poles said all along he needed to be blown away to stick at #1 and take a QB last year. By the time the combine rolled around he all but announced to the world the pick was for sale. I understand Fields showed flashes towards the end of last year and that played into that decision. 

Fast forward to now and Stroud is blowing everyone away.

I think it's fair to question what our staff missed on Stroud to be out on him immediately and whether or not we should be worried about them making the next decision on who our QB is.

2023-11-12,1699813384,Bears Drafting a Top QB Prospect: Hopeful or Hopeless?,"I've seen some people on here make some claims that the QB situation here is hopeless when it comes to Williams or Maye. That we'll never be able to draft and develop a QB. I also see the other side where people say the draft is a complete gamble, and no one really knows if someone's game will translate to the NFL. I also saw someone as the honest question: 

*Do the Bears fail at drafting and developing QB's more than the rest of the league?*

I'm a lifelong sports fan, but a relatively new Bear's fan (I have my reasons for recently becoming a Bear's fan& not the point of the post). I didn't know the answer to the question, so thought I'd do a bit of digging into draft data and share. 

A couple caveats before I jump into it:

1. I've only included data since the 1990 draft. I had to draw the line somewhere, so I picked the start of a decade that I figured would be relevant to most of the sub. 
2. Pure data lacks context, and context is important. Not all drafts are equal and not all teams enter drafts with the same priorities. Trades happen. FA happens. The numbers represent imperfect humans who have been subjectively scouted and drafted by other imperfect humans.

Lastly... to answer the question, we really need to look at it as two parts.

1. How much draft capital has each team allocated to finding their QB?
2. How successful has each team been at turning that draft capital into productive NFL QB's?

This post looks only at part 1 because it can be objectively determined with data, for the most part. 

Part 2 is infinitely harder to evaluate because a lot of it is subjective and up for debate. That's also what makes it way more fun. It's what fuels lively discussions over beers between friends and rivals. It's what separates great front offices and coaching staffs from raw analytics and predictions. It's the annual narratives of draft busts, as well as those of Mr. Irrelevant and TB12, picked at 199. It's the human side of the game that I'm hoping gets fleshed out in the comments.

* Most common first name of drafted QB's since 1990: Matt (11), Mike (9), Jeff (8), John (8), Josh (8), Ryan (7).

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to include full lists for everything, but I did include photos of the lists of the JF1 cutoff, as well as top 5 1990, sorted by team.

I think the data is interesting... It's clear that some teams have been very lucky, and hit on their only real shot at drafting a franchise QB in the last 34 years (KC with Mahomes, BUF with Allen). Others needed to try a number of times before succeeding (CIN, JAX). Others haven't really spent high draft capital on QB's at all (DAL, NO), maybe due to philosophy, or maybe due need. 

As it pertains to the Bears, it seems like there's some recency bias from Trubisky and Fields. It seems like we've taken an average, or slightly below average number of shots at finding a QB, relative to the rest of the league. Now as far as developing that draft capital... I'll let everyone duke it out in the comments.

I personally like JF1, and would like nothing better than to see him succeed, but would it be all that surprising if he didn't? I don't think so. One only needs to browse the draft records to find many examples of QB's who were drafted higher who have accomplished less. Maybe JF1 will show us what we need to see in the last 7 games, but if he doesn't, can we at least take one more *hopeful* shot at a top prospect QB before we call it hopeless? That would put is in the top half of the league for high value draft picks spent on a field general.

Now, regardless of what happens behind center, for that individual to success, we need a new coaching staff. ",CHIBears,13,0,0.4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHIBears/comments/17tq6oi/bears_drafting_a_top_qb_prospect_hopeful_or/,football,NA
2023-11-12,1699811399,The more the season goes on the more I think Flus gets another year. Also think it's smarter to keep fields and build the trenches and get MHJ. I think Caleb Williams and fields are essentially the same qb very similar qualities. Both also hold the ball.,"One thing is clear. Poles likes flus as long as there is improvement they will retain flus. The run defense got better and the past few games defense entirely looks getter. O line looks better than last year. Poles ain't going anywhere and either is flus. Don't let the national media fool you. 

The only benefit I see in drafting Williams is resetting the qb contract. Fields still under contract and they are basically the same player. Enough with the Tyson bad gent comparisons lol. He beat the raiders when they had Brian hoyer and a terrible panthers team. He's showed he's a good back up. Not one time did I think he was better than fields though that's obvious and if you think other wise your brain dead. I like Tyson but he's a backup not a starter. Let's go get either and edge, 3 tech, LT and MHJ. Get Austin a Center either draft Van Pran or pay a center good money. Move on from white hair. Get another guard in the draft. Tot trade down one of those picks but either way I think keeping fields is the right answer. Ok everyone let me have it now because I know there's a ton of people that don't agree.

I understand the blue chip argument and I think getting some injured players back and adding Montez Sweat is slowly creating the semblance of a team with a future especially given the draft capital.

The more I see the Patriots, Cardinals, Panthers, Colts, Giants, and Broncos play the more I think the Bears have a better product on the field and a significantly brighter future.

I also think the Steelers will start to unravel with their unwatchable offense.

I live in Packer country and these people are already smashing the panic button. I think there is more murkiness about their current direction than what Poles is doing.

As much as this sub wants a winner, I think ending the season with 6 wins, significant cap space, and a boatload of picks will attract a better coach this cycle.

2023-11-12,1699804009,"IMO: the fact that we are able to win some games (regardless of opponent) with a D2 Rookie, proves that we, at the very least, have a decent foundation of a roster. The staff is just that terrible.","I believe Fields may not be the answer, but it's clear as day that the kid is quite an athlete. He seems to be a teachable, mendable player that could easily excel at his postion if given a proper coaching staff. Eberflus and Getsy may very well have ruined the kid, but lets see what happens these last few weeks. 

The staff is clear as day the biggest farce on this team (besides Velus Jones Jr). We have had two coaches fired in the middle of the season due to some sort of hush-hush reason along with having a bumbling idiot of a head coach in Eberfuls as proven by recent interviews (need I remind you of HITS?). Getsy hasn't proven to be any wiser, with his ridiculous screen calls, run plays on 2nd and long, and negligent attitude by not playing to the QB's overall strengths. Poles has done an OK job finding certain players, and the Carolina trade was an absolute fleece. But his Claypool trade for a second rounder, along with his clear lack of perceiving coaching talent, makes me question if he should stick around or kick rocks with the coaching staff. 

It's not a flex in the slightest to beat teams like Vegas or Carolina, but beating them with a rookie D2 backup proves that, despite what many people say, we dont have anywhere near that bad of a roster. I do think this roster has pieces that we can build upon rather quickly and see decent results if we had the proper staff.

2023-11-12,1699776487,The eberflus defence this year has been more frustrating to watch than it is actually bad.,"Btw- this is NOT a keep flus post. I just think the defence gets a lot of blame because of the stigma of last year sticking to it. Some of which is misdirected. 

Since Flus has been calling plays in week 2, the DEFENCE has given up

20 points vs tampa (-7 from pick 6)

41 points vs chiefs (easily could have been more tbf)

24 points vs broncos (-7 fumble 6)

20 commanders 

Vikings 12 (-7 fumble 6)

Raiders 13 

Chargers 30

Saints 24

Panthers 6 (-7 punt return TD)

= 21.11 defensive points allowed per game. 


Do I like soft zones? No. Is this skewed by getting to play some garbage teams and kc taking mercy? A little. Is the defence as bad as it looks? No. Giving up the underneath routes for free gets you picked apart by good qbs, but pressure should change that, and even still, the defence is *serviceable*. It looks bad with missed tackles, easy completions, and no pressure, but it has been keeping the offence in games the offence can't finish. 

This defence gets blamed a lot. Situationally, doesn't pass the eye test, but it probably isn't as bad as you think when you account for scores the offence spotted them.

10-2 Record (obviously hoping for better)

I think the WRs will explode this year. Thomas, Merriweather, Colzie (who didn't get enough credit, he made some major clutch catches). Experienced QB at the helm. I know we won't be throwing 50 times a game but I'm thinking we'll actually have a good deep passing game. 

Defensively I think we'll see the biggest improvement. Golden knows that if he produces a good defense this year Head Coaching jobs are calling. Expecting a big jump from 1st to 2nd season.

This series of posts will be to determine what the community believes to be members of the All Irish Team. 

I wanted to get the community's input before we start.  Right now I'm thinking to have a post, lets say for QB, for the nominations that I can leave it up 3 days or a week whichever the community decides.  I'm leaning to 3 days so we can get this done a little quicker.  After those 3 days are up I'll put the top 3 nominations in a poll and then make another post.   That post will stay up for 3 days and the top vote getter will be our rep for the All Irish Team. 

Another poster suggested that we keep it to the last 20 years.  Thoughts on this?  Would you like there to be a time frame from which we choose the All Irish Team?

What do you guys think about this?  Any ideas an input are more than welcome.

2023-02-14,1676415521,Can we all just take a breath real quick?,"I'm seeing such strong and visceral reactions to the result of a coaching search that hasn't even concluded yet. I wanted Ludwig too, but let's slow down. He wasn't the start and end of our list. Are we still going to be mad about this buyout if tomorrow we announce Bill Belichick as our new OC? Obviously, that's not happening but I think my point stands. They can still bring in a great hire. 

Everyone on here seems to think they have the whole situation figured out. They know just where we went wrong and how Jack Swarbrick has failed us all. Really what we know is that we interviewed Ludwig, there was mutual interest, and the buyout was an obstacle. I, too, am disappointed that money has  seemingly once again held us back from signing a great coordinator, but that's a pretty surface level understanding of the situation. 

I don't claim to be an expert on buyouts in college football, especially not for coordinators. I have followed professional sports long enough to understand that contract negotiations do not happen in a vacuum. There is a lot to consider. If I am an NFL team signing a star player to a new contract, there's a good chance I am setting the market for all other free agents to negotiate by. If Notre Dame decided they were willing to pay a multimillion dollar buyout for a coordinator, they likely have to consider the effect that will have on contracts across the entire country. Especially because they are one of the most influential teams in college football. Maybe they all sat down and decided Utah was asking an extortionist rate that would set a dangerous precedent that they were unwilling to commit to. Like I said, I don't really know anything about college coaching contracts and buyouts so feel free to educate me, but I could see this being a realistic and defensible position. 

I see comments on here saying Freeman should leave. Maybe he was the one who decided that the buyout was too costly. It seems unlikely but we don't know. If you watched the Manti T'eo doc on Netflix you will have seen former athletic department employees lauding Jack Swarbrick for his communication when making a decision. He strives to be transparent so that even if you don't agree with his decision, you understand how he made it. I guarantee Marcus Freeman was involved in every step of the hiring process and would have understood any larger implications the buyout had, whether those were internal budgeting issues or external market issues. 

And speaking of Swarbrick. It's insane to me that people want him fired. He is not a perfect AD. Our basketball program has fallen too far behind under his watch as one example. This is not the first time we have failed to pony up for a coach fans wanted, no denying that. That said, he is one of the most powerful and influential people in college athletics and has successfully exerted that power and influence to the benefit of ND countless times. Our partnership with the ACC has helped us remain competitive nationally while protecting our independence as much as it could. Speaking of the ACC, getting us in for the COVID year as a full member was critical to the trajectory of our program, though admittedly a bit of a no brainer for both parties. Most recently he was one of a few people paved the way for a 12 team playoff in a format that would best suit Notre Dame. 

Who do we think we're replacing him with? The office he holds comes with inherent power and influence in college football, but not to the extent Jack has taken it. He is intelligent, thorough, and very well thought of by his piers, that's why he is involved with virtually every major shake up in College Football in some capacity. Notre Dame would be silly to fire him on a whim without an absolute home run hire waiting, and I don't know who that is.",notredamefootball,70,59,0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/112irb1/can_we_all_just_take_a_breath_real_quick/,college,NA

2023-02-13,1676312895,2023 Notre Dame Baseball Preview,"In addition to my preview below, here are articles from [the Observer](https://ndsmcobserver.com/2023/02/notre-dame-baseball-preview-redefining-the-attitude-around-irish-baseball/) and Irish Sports Daily [Part 1](https://irishsportsdaily.com/s/19901/qa-with-notre-dame-baseball-coach-shawn-stiffler-part-i) and [Part 2](https://irishsportsdaily.com/s/19909/qa-with-notre-dame-baseball-coach-shawn-stiffler-part-ii). 

It's time for a new season of the game where athletic guys take turns hitting a ball with a piece of metal! 
The Irish come off their most successful season in 20 years, reaching Omaha for the first time since 2002. Alas, it came at the cost of Link Jarrett and the whole coaching staff, who all moved down south to Florida State to see they are the chosen ones to finally lead FSU to a national title.

As a result of Link's prowess, though, the Notre Dame job is much more attractive now than it was four years ago. The Irish were able to hire VCU's **Shawn Stiffler**, who brings along **Seth Voltz** as his pitching coach. **Logan Robbins** joins as the hitting coach and **Ryan Munger** rounds out the staff as the third assistant coach. 

Roster wise, the Irish are in better shape than one might expect. In the hitting order, the Irish return multiple senior and grad students, including the top two home run hitters **Brooks Coetzee** and **Jack Zyska**. Despite losing 5 of their 9 batters from last season, the Irish will only lose about 35% of their overall hitting production. Additionally, several of the underclassmen who will make the lineup this season saw playing time in mop up duty, giving the 2023 batting order more experience than realized. 



Category| Hits | HR | RBI
---|---|----|----
2022 Total |476|65|322
2023 Returning |301|42|208
Production Lost| 37%	|35%|35%
			

	
	


. 

In the field, the Irish will be in good position. The infield loses stud third baseman **Jack Brannigan** and phenomenal second baseman **Jared Miller**, but shortstop **Zach Prajzner** and first baseman **Carter Putz** will anchor the infield. Rising sophomore **Jack Penney** will fill in at second base, continuing off from last year when he filled as a result of Miller's injury. The most likely candidate for third base is going to be rising junior **Casey Kmet**. Outfielders will Zyska in left field, rising sophomore **TJ Williams** in centerfield, and Coetzee in right field. Rising sophomore **DM Jefferson** will likely be the designated hitter. 

On the mound is where the Irish will face a lot of questions. They graduated their two consistent starters in John Michael Bertrand and Austin Temple. However, they do have stud rising sophomore **Jack ""Motherfucking"" Findlay**, a left-handed pitcher who earned a reputation for ice-cold performances in the postseason last year. Reliable returners also include left-handers **Aidan Tyrell and Will Mercer**; and right-handed relievers **Jackson Dennies** and **Radek Birkholz** also return. Newcomers include freshman **David Lally Jr.**, a highly rated right-handed pitcher out of high school who can also hit (look for him to get some looks as a utility player the same way Jack Brannigan was used in prior seasons), and graduate students **Blake Hely** and **Justin Moore**, both right-handed pitchers as well. 

While there are a lot of questions with how Stiffler will develop the bullpen, he has earned his bread and butter as a pitching coach. The previous three of the four full seasons, his teams have averaged under 4.0 ERA. With the upgrade in overall talent, Stiffler should hope to have a team ERA of 3.75-3.85 this season. One improvement that Stiffler should seek from the bullpen is not having late game collapses that plagued the Irish often last year, especially with giving up home runs in late innings.

My uneducated guess at the weekend rotation: 

**Friday  Jack Findlay**

**Saturday- Blake Hely**

**Sunday  Jackson Dennies**

**Relievers  Will Mercer, Radek Birkholz, Aiden Tyrell**

In the hitting order, Stiffler and Robbins need to get the slugging percentages for Coetzee and Zyska up: If he can get each of them to hit 6-8 more home runs this year, that will allow Notre Dame to keep pace with where it left off offensively. TJ Williams and Danny Neri both have experience under their belts from starting games intermittently this year and should at least make the middle/bottom of the order tenable. One question for the hitters: will they utilize the bunts and hit-and-runs the way they did under Jarrett? 

My uneducated guess at the lineup for opening day: 

1)	Brooks Coetzee 

2)	Carter Putz

3)	Jack Zyska

4)	Zach Prajzner 

5)	Jack Penney

6)	DM Jefferson

7)	TJ Williams 

8)	Danny Neri

9)	Casey Kmet

When the Irish open the season, they play 21 games against teams that made the NCAA tournament last year. The non-conference slate against Lipscomb, UAB, and UNCG should be handled with relative ease. The three toughest series for them will likely come from ACC play: one will be a road series against Louisville, who swept the Irish last year, another will be a road series at Wake Forest (who is a preseason top 10 team), and the final one will be a homecoming series against Florida State late in the season, where Link and his staff will return to Frank Eck for the first time in over a year. 

There are some mountains in this schedule, but it is not impossible to traverse. Winning one of the Louisville or FSU series should give the Irish a good resume boost in the RPI metric, and the format of the ACC tournament should allow them to utilize their bullpen well to make some noise. The Irish have a fair amount of talent returning. However, there will be questions about whether or not Stiffler and the staff can develop the young hitters and pitchers simply because the whole staff is new. Therefore, the expectations for this year should not hinge on whether or not the Irish make the NCAA Baseball Tournament; instead, the focus should be the improvement of the players over the season. There is no reason to not think that Notre Dame can't be a consistent participant in baseball regionals next year and beyond. If Notre Dame does make a regional this year, Stiffler deserves an A for getting the program ahead of schedule. 

*Cool, thanks for the recap! How can I watch Notre Dame Baseball?*

- To channel my inner lawyer, **it depends**. College baseball, despite being a great thing, does not get the love it deserves from TV stations. Most of the Notre Dame games will be broadcast on ACC Network and its regional affiliates. The out of conference games are where it gets tricky: I have watched games on ESPN+, B1G Network (it sucks), and even FloSports (surprisingly decent). I have followed games with no broadcast  I listened to a game last year on Michigan State radio and I got updates on a game via StatCast. The one silver lining is that the **Notre Dame Baseball Twitter account** is very good about getting broadcast information out. It also provides good score updates if you only want to look at one medium.
 
- If you're privileged enough to go to home games at Frack Eck Stadium, you can get into the stadium for **free**. It's small, but it's easy to get to park around and get to the concessions. And if you're feeling brave, you can heckle the opposing pitchers into wild throws!",notredamefootball,1,8,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/111g5oo/2023_notre_dame_baseball_preview/,college,NA

Personally, I've softened my stance on it a bit though. We seem to be on the verge of having two super conferences (SEC and B1G) take all the brand names and create an NFL Junior league. Notre Dame joining the B1G would be a huge move to get this minor league started. I would hate if that happened, as I think it would ruin CFB as a sport. 

But if Notre Dame joins the ACC full time in football, it would allow the ACC to survive and prevent the SEC and B1G from pillaging the conference. 

So would you be okay with ND giving up its independence if it meant the sport as we know it survived?",notredamefootball,17,0,0.25,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/10z46qt/thoughts_on_potentially_joining_the_acc_as_a_full/,college,NA

On the one hand (negative) as long as ND doesn't join a Conference, they can't be seeded #1-#4 in the playoff format, meaning that even if they are on #1 they are seeded 5th in the playoff format. 

On the other hand (positive) in 5/11 cases where ND reaches the playoffs they are ranked #5 and have a home game against the best G5 team (realistically that team will nearly always be #12), and in 3 more of the cases they will have a home game against #9/#10/#11, so there is no team that has as high chances for a playoff home game as ND, but they will always have to play some team coming from a bye week afterwards, even if that team was ranked lower than ND.",notredamefootball,31,17,0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/129laft/what_do_nd_fans_think_about_the_new_college/,college,NA

2023-06-10,1686420778,/r/NotreDameFootball will be joining the API protest June 12th-14th.,"Hello /r/NotreDameFootball,

I come bearing bad news.  Reddit has decided to screw over 3rd party apps.  It has been an outrageous few days to say the least.  The big thing is the amount reddit has decided to charge for access to their API.  As you may have heard from other subreddits you are [subscribed to](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) there will be a blackout in protest of these changes.

After some Mod Discussion we have decided to join the blackout.  This will mean that you will not be able to access the subreddit from the 12th to the 14th.  

Spez decided to do an AMA about this and it was a shitshow.  You can find a recap of it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145bzus/ceo_spez_ama_overview/). [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) is a direct link to the AMA if you'd like to peruse it yourself.

These changes will impact apps like Reddit Is Fun, Apollo and a host of others.  There is also worry that it will eventually [impact things like RES](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/141hyv3/announcement_res_reddits_upcoming_api_changes/) and toolbox.

To me this is a signal that they are actually, this time, preparing for their IPO and want to squeeze every last dime out of this place.  After years of ignoring user requests, shoving crappy changes in our faces and just being general dicks to the people who make these communities what they are I feel that this may be Reddit's Digg moment.  Time will tell.  

It really makes me question the time I've spent growing, moderating and creating content for the communities here.

Then [Texas happened](https://youtu.be/dI7kwB9nkA8?t=126). Not only was it the Longhorn's first win over a Top-10 opponent at home since Oct. 25, 2008, it led Notre Dame to an eventual 4-8 season. ""[Texas, IS BACK FOLKS!](https://youtu.be/WVlI7u4V9cE?t=967)""

My question is I know tickets are starting to trickle out on the secondary market from season ticket holders and through June and July more will come available.  Right now on stubhub with fees cheapest I'm looking at is about 400$+ so my question is, will this be the cheapest they ever are? Or do you anticipate once all tickets are available and people adjust the pricing could come down some?

My first thought was, did I miss any news or something?  Not sure if there was an article I may have missed recently that talked about him becoming AD recently.  It may have been this [article](https://fightingirishwire.usatoday.com/lists/notre-dame-football-brady-quinn/).  But I got to thinking and I kind of like the idea to be honest.  I think him working with FUND has been great so far.  I think he has the drive and love of Notre Dame to be successful in the role.  To be clear I don't think this will happen anytime soon.

2023-05-13,1684007014,Where to Sit at Notre Dame Stadium?,"Hello!

A few friends of mine are planning to visit for the USC-ND game later this season. Before buying tickets for these pricier games, I like to check in with the fans on the ground about anything I ought to know about sections, views, etc. I promise we'll be wearing green and rooting on the Irish.

I would like to get the full Touchdown Jesus view from the south end zone. The sightlines of the field from the end zone corners don't look awesome from what I can gather from the rate my seats and what-have-you type of websites (by all means, correct me if I'm wrong). So I think we're down to 118-120.

Are any of those sections away team seating, designated student section, anything like that? Is a northwestern view any better than a northeastern view? Are there any obstructions, nuances -- just stuff you wouldn't think of if you hadn't been there before -- that we ought to keep in mind? Or can I go ahead and buy any of them with confidence?

Any feedback is much appreciated! Thanks, and go on and beat Ohio State.",notredamefootball,13,8,0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/13gqs24/where_to_sit_at_notre_dame_stadium/,college,NA

2023-04-26,1682467483,Notre Dame Recruiting  Now vs A Year Ago,"Since it is a pretty quiet news day for Notre Dame football, I thought it was a good time to assess how Notre Dame is recruiting now vs how they were doing a year ago.

Thanks to our good friend u/GoldandBlue, we have a good snapshot of ND recruiting over time.  Here is how the Irish looked on 25 April, 2022: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/ubfv0q/state\_of\_recruiting\_week\_of\_425/](https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/ubfv0q/state_of_recruiting_week_of_425/)

At the time, ND had the **#1** recruiting class in the nation for 2023. **Eleven** players had made verbal pledges, with an average player rating of **91.8**. All were Blue Chip athletes (ie 4-star or 5-star recruits). **Five** players were in the Top 100 nationally. **Eight** in the Top 250. All in the Top 350.

Now of course, we're assessing how things looked at the time.' Obviously, some player ratings changed. Some went up, others went down. And&\*spoiler alert\* &. players like Keon Keeley and Peyton Bowen did not end up committing to the Irish on signing day. 

\-------------------------

So, how does Irish recruiting look right now?

[https://247sports.com/Season/2024-Football/CompositeTeamRankings/](https://247sports.com/Season/2024-Football/CompositeTeamRankings/)

ND currently has the **#8** recruiting class in the nation for 2024. **Ten** total players have made verbal pledges, with an average player rating of **91.4**. 8/10 are Blue Chip athletes. **Two** players are in the Top 100 nationally. **Three** are in the Top 250. Four players are ranked less than 350.

\-------------------------

There appear to be some noticeable differences between now and a year ago. 

The total average player rating and number of recruits are about the same. This might surprise you, but the difference in rating does not scale linearly with player ranking (ie, the difference in rating between the #1 player and the #50 player is greater than the difference in rating between the #50 and #250 player). What is surprising is that ND was ranked #1 last year, and is much lower this year. This seems to imply that other schools are ramping up faster than they were last year.

The difference in Top players, especially Top 250 players (8 a year ago; 3 today) is noticeable. Is recruiting slowing down; is Freeman settling more? Why the change? 

\-Maybe Freeman is still trying to go after the higher players, but is not as fortunate as he was at this time last year? Could the excitement/hype' from a new coach be wearing off? Might top players be turned off after viewing last year's results against Marshall and Stanford?

\-Maybe Freeman is not investing as much time/effort into going after top players? Seeing multiple top players abandon the 2023 class may have changed Freeman's expectations and strategy moving forward? Maybe after having a year of coaching experience under his belt, Freeman has a better idea of who he wants to target and go after? 

\-Is NIL the main culprit? Could Freeman be avoiding going after top talent because he now knows ND cannot afford' it? Maybe recruits are more familiar with the NIL process than they were a year ago, and top players are not as apt to give ND the time of day?

What are your thoughts on the differences between last year and this year  and what can explain the change?  

Is recruiting better this year?  (Less chance of losing players last minute, better 'ND-fit' guys)

Or is it worse? (Lower overall talent = bad)",notredamefootball,39,15,0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/12z0kn4/notre_dame_recruiting_now_vs_a_year_ago/,college,NA

My point is that this entire thing is based on money, and that stupid B1G 10 fanfics about them excluding ND are delusional at best given how much more money the conference could make.

2023-08-04,1691173275,The most common reasons for staying independent and the arguments against them.,"1) Tradition. This to me is the most illogical for wanting to stay put. Times change and making decisions solely based on the reasoning that it's always been this way is the most dangerous to killing the brand. If we stay in the past while everyone around us adapts to the future we will be left behind. 

2) ND is bigger than any conference. This may have been true decades ago but that is clearly no longer the case. Conferences powers have grown while ND has struggled to reach it's former glory. Very few teams outside of Bama have the ability to claim they're bigger than the conference (and Bama actually embraces themselves as the embodiment of the SEC). 

3) a) The perks that come with being independent. This one I think is the most understandable. For years the school negotiated it's own TV contract, something no other schools could claim, and often this would result in a more lucrative contract than what they'd get from revenue sharing in a conference. That is again no longer the case. Conferences are pulling in record revenue and the schools are getting a larger share than ever before. 

3b)Another aspect of the TV contract argument was geographic: Notre Dame was one of the few who's primary fan base wasn't allocated to a certain state, with fans being all over the country, something that would be hampered by the geographically locked conferences. Again, this is no longer a concern. With the siphoning of the PAC12/ACC, conferences are now based on the biggest names rather than region, with the Big10 now touching every part of the country. 

3c) Scheduling. In years past we had the most diverse schedule in football, playing some of our oldest rivals from all over the country as well as being able to play some of the biggest names in the country. This too is in danger of dying. With the bloating of the major conferences, the evidence is clear that there will be little room (and little need) for non conference regular season games. This means less major teams willing and/or capable of playing us. Conferences will prioritize their own schedules and will not make efforts to accommodate non conference teams, including Notre Dame. 

3d) The playoffs. The 12 team format starts next year and with the current format, the 6 highest ranked power conference teams will get automatic bids. But with the current murky future of once power conferences, I could easily see this changing to favor the larger conferences even more. So with the first 6 seeds guaranteed to a conference team, our odds are lesser. There's no doubt Notre Dame teams of the past were given the nod due to their name but how long can we expect that to last? Especially with a less competitive schedule? 

I think the evidence is very clear that the argument for independence is antiquated and that it's time to move forward or get left behind.",notredamefootball,21,0,0.34,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/15i7mbr/the_most_common_reasons_for_staying_independent/,college,NA

2023-07-27,1690473197,Practice report rumblings.,"It's interesting following from different sources to hear the various takes and how much they can differ from the experts.  Not going into specifics that are behind paywalls as both ISD and II have great premium content, but I did want some overall discussion of the two and maybe where reality might lay. 

I would describe ISD's Mike Frank as being a realist sometimes almost to the point of pessimism, but he seems pretty high on Hartman and the receivers in general.  He's also somewhat bullish on the DL at edge (great news).  Best of all he thought Hartman looked great out there, maybe took a few too many risks but didn't seem concerned. 

Meanwhile at II, they didn't like Hartman's first day and seemed pessimistic of the WR's day one, with admission it could have been the CB's just flat out stymying them.  

Both sources seemed really high on our RB's and especially the secondary though.  TBD with the OL and linebackers.  

I think our secondary is going to REALLY open up some eyes by shutting down OSU's passing game.  They have great WR's for sure, they're probably the only team better at WR than we are in the secondary, but they don't have a stud QB (at least not by game 5, not even Trevor Lawrence was that guy in game 5 in 2018) to make us pay for a slight gap there.  

The biggest question is if we're going to be successful on offense against them or if we can shut down their run, in my opinion. 

Looks like the media is getting a bit more access this year.  I think more time away from covid plus having 4-5 games in front of OSU helps a lot there, I don't blame Freeman for not wanting to give much away ahead of last year's opener.",notredamefootball,26,22,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/15b5ht5/practice_report_rumblings/,college,NA

The 42nd season of the International Simulation Football League is wrapping up, which means that it is a great time to create a player and join! The ISFL is a free online sim league where you create a professional football player and control their journey through the pros from pre-draft to retirement. With over 30 player archetypes to choose from, you can be anything from a pass-catching running back to a ball hawking safety or even a strong legged kicker. 


Your player will compete in games (simulated using Draft Day Sports: Pro Football 2021) throughout the week that premiere on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ISFL) nightly. Each 16-game season lasts about 6 weeks, including playoffs, followed by a 2 week offseason. Complete stats are recorded on the [league index](https://index.sim-football.com/ISFLS42/), and we also have cool user-made tools to keep track of [historical records](https://isfl-bot.herokuapp.com/) and [our very own Hall of Fame](https://wiki.sim-football.com/view/List_of_ISFL_Hall_of_Fame_inductees).


With hundreds of players and over 20 teams across the developmental and major leagues, the ISFL is also an active online community. Joining a team is not only a chance to see your player succeed, but also to hang out with fellow users in the Discord server that serves as your team's locker room. You'll be joining a tight-knit group of like-minded people who enjoy getting a bit nerdy about football and root together for your players when they take the simulated field.


## Sounds Great! How Do I Start?


If you want to jump in right away, a great place to start is to join the [ISFL Rookie Discord](https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH). Our team of rookie mentors will be happy to answer any questions and assist you with creating your player and getting started on your ISFL career! If you want to read more about the process first, we have a great [Rookie Guide](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235) written up on the league forums, or a [short version](https://www.reddit.com/r/SimulationFootball/comments/10ql6st/welcome_to_the_isfl_introduction_getting_started/) on our subreddit, r/SimulationFootball.


## What Happens After I Create My Player?


After making your player, you'll be scouted by teams that are entirely run by other users in the league and drafted to a developmental team in the DSFL Draft on Thursday, August 3. Just like the games, the YouTube channel streams all our offseason events including drafts, awards shows, and the Prospect Bowl that your new player will compete in!


During your player's career, you can improve their attributes by spending 10-15 minutes completing optional tasks each week, like predicting the winners of each game or mocking the 1st round of the draft. The league is 100% free - there is no ""pay to win"" and nothing costs real money to unlock. You will earn fake league currency through your player's contracts or through creating content like media (ranging from [statistical breakdowns](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=46372) to [mock drafts](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=46353) to [fun fluff pieces](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=46307)), [graphics](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=45222), or [podcasts](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=46286). You can use it to further upgrade your player and do fun things like collecting trading cards of ISFL players!

Hey Domers.  Finally making the trip to my first ever game at Notre Dame stadium and want to make the most of it. We're heading down for the Home opener vs. Tennessee State and got a spot in the North lots as a home base.

Any tips for tailgating? 

What's the ND beer of choice in the lots? Natural Light? Bud? We're coming down from Ontario and will be bringing some Canadian craft beers that we're happy to share, but what else should we pick up to share?

Where can we get some worthwhile food on our way in to campus? Is it really social where we can just wander around and other fans will welcome us?

&amp;nbsp;

Welcome back Irish fans to another season of Notre Dame football!  This year we kick off the season in Ireland to face off against our old time rivals, Navy in Dublin.  With a new leader in transfer QB Sam Hartman the Irish offense looks to get the season started with a bang.   The defense looks to develop a new crop of elite players as well so this should be a great season of Irish football.

2023-08-19,1692406548,Assessing Talent of Notre Dame's 2023 Team,"We are about one week away, so it's time to start looking at talent and position rankings.  I'm currently tracking 83 scholarship players -- not sure if the coaching staff will award scholarships to a couple of walk-ons soon, or maybe I'm just missing something (scholarship limit is 85).

The following table lists average recruit ratings (247 composite) by position (2023 vs 2022).  Where applicable, a player's transfer rating was used instead of their original high school rating.  In some cases, this was a very large bump up (ie Sam Hartman); but in others, it was a very large knock down (ie Devyn Ford). 

[Notre Dame Position Ratings: 2023 vs 2022 \(data gathered from 247 Composite\)](https://preview.redd.it/z5yyg2avryib1.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c0b840997600bbd65865a1bea69d48a5311bb0d)

Of note, the team is overall more talented this year compared to last year (.9144 vs .9079).  

According to 247, Notre Dame had the 10th most talented roster in the country last year.  [https://247sports.com/Season/2022-Football/CollegeTeamTalentComposite/](https://247sports.com/Season/2022-Football/CollegeTeamTalentComposite/)It will be interesting to see how this changes this year (expect a slight increase).

Obviously, this is a very imperfect analysis for several reasons.  Joe Alt is the best player on the team, and his rating is below .90.  CB is very talented and deep this year, but the rating here does not reflect that.  Take this all with a grain of salt.  Individual areas may not matter -- but in totality it does, which is why teams like Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio State are winning so much.

\*You may see discrepancies with ratings vs 247 data.  They are constantly changing numbers on their website, and it's impossible to keep up with everything.

This could be too good to be true but my thing is, why scam for $50?? I spoke to ND ticket office as well and they were confused as well but did say that they do partner with vettix.

So I'm hoping those of you that attended can share the following:

But shortly before the 07 season started,Weis said that he would be the starter ,as expected.

Not due to looking like a great QB or a leader...but because he ""made the most plays"" in practice.

He went 1 for 3 for 4 passing yards and lost two fumbles in 1 half against GT that year.

He never suited up with ND or as a QB at all again

He left for Cincinnati in 08 (Brian Kelly was the coach) and he played as a linebacker until transferring to a D2 school in 2010 as a WR

2023-09-03,1693753758,Opinions on the biggest ND overachievers and the biggest waste of talent?,"After the Navy game, Brady Quinn said that this year's Notre Dame team is the best in terms of overall speed, size, athleticism, talent, etc. on both sides of the ball that he can remember. I have very few memories of the great Notre Dame teams under Holtz because I was a child at the time. I have one memory from ND's title year, and that was Rocket's touchdown against West Virginia and my father laughing in amazement at how fast he was. However, with regard to ND teams that I've seen in my adult life, I think I agree with Quinn. This is probably the best/most complete team I've seen out of Notre Dame. Whether that translates to a playoff appearance or a NY6 victory is yet to be seen, but as of right now, this team is probably better than any team I've seen over the last 25 years or so. If they finish with three or more losses, that would be considered a monumental waste of talent. That got me thinking. Out of all the Notre Dame teams anyone on here has seen, which two are the biggest disappointments and the biggest overachievers? Here are my picks:

**The Guns n Roses of Notre Dame football teams (biggest waste of talent):**

The 2009 team. That team had Jimmy Clausen, Kyle Rudolph, Michael Floyd, Golden Tate, Theo Riddick, Tyler Eifert, Robert Hughes, Manti Teo, Harrison Smith, Robert Blanton, Zeke Motta, Kapron Lewis-Moore, and others. They had a total of 20 future NFL players evenly distributed across the offense and defense, and they finished 6-6. It's incredible to think that a team with that much talent ended the season at .500. They only played four true road games, and only one of those was against a ranked opponent. No wonder Weis was fired afterward.

Honorable mention: The 2015 team. Brian Kelly has gone on record as saying that the 2015 team was his most talented on the offensive side of the ball. The defense was loaded with talent as well. Off the top of my head, the D had Jaylon Smith, James Onwualu, Nyles Morgan, Jerry Tillery, Sheldon Day, and Romeo Okwara. Sure, they finished 10-3, but that team had the talent to win the national championship. Unfortunately, their defensive coordinator was Brian Van Gorder, so they needed to win most of their games via shootout.

**The '87 Minnesota Twins of Notre Dame football teams (plukiest overachievers):**

Perhaps predictable, but I have to go with the 2012 team. Sure, that team had talent, but most of it was on the defensive side of the ball. On offense, the team oftentimes chewed up clock and put in long sustained drives. Like Ice Man from Top Gun, they just wore defenses down. ""You get bored, frustrated, do something stupid, and he's got ya."" That's kind of how they operated. I remember the Boston College game from that year. Every one of their touchdown drives seemed to take forever, and the BC defenders appeared to be visually frustrated over the fact that they couldn't get off the field. Golson was more of a game manager; their most talented offensive weapons were Eifert, Riddick, and TJ Jones. The defense was very, very good that year, but something the Alabama players said after the national championship stuck with me. They all said that the ND defense was fundamentally sound, but it was strategically simple and easy to game-plan for; it was basic. It's surreal to think that Notre Dame was one Kansas State bed-shitting away from facing the Wildcats in the national championship game. I think ND wins that game.

Honorable mention: The 2018 team. That team scraped by Michigan, Ball State, and Vanderbilt only to bench their starting quarterback for the savvy, uber-reliable but not incredibly talented Ian Book. There was some darn good talent on that team (on both sides of the ball), but I thought they were ahead of schedule in derms of peaking. In hindsight, I think the '19 or '20 teams were better overall.

Anyway, that's my list. What are your thoughts on this?",notredamefootball,18,18,0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/168zf8v/opinions_on_the_biggest_nd_overachievers_and_the/,college,NA

2023-09-03,1693714298,Stadium Experience,"Crowd was so awesome today, if we can have that level of fire that we had after the non targeting call and then the hilarious lengthy goal to go stand that featured timeouts and false start penalties. Was disappointed they didn't play the video about how Notre Dame stadium gets loud during that sequence.  I'm not gonna rag on the home crowd like I typically would for a game like this, no need to scream for three hours against an FCS opponent,  kinda had Navy vibes with how it was about a lot more than just football.  If the crowd brings that energy for the whole game for OSU we will actually be a hostile environment for once.  Today the crowd had an edge to it when needed, loved it!

I enjoyed getting to see a different culture come into stuffy ND stadium Haha, my conservative side says the dancers and their outfits was a bit on the risque side but other than that all the band stuff was awesome.  I hope it riled up some boomers at least.  Music choices seemed better today, maybe the DJ helps.

Shout out Hartman hiding behind the guy and Estime dropping an f bomb for the whole stadium postgame.

Walking out I was near some ushers and apparently there were quite a few heat and dehydration issues, long lines to get expensive waters today I guess with credit card reader issues.  Seems like a spot where ND can do better, especially given their what will you fight for being about helping people...  maybe make waters a little easier to access for your fans paying a lot to get in?  Anyways...

Some interesting notes:

\-Notre Dame has more Blue Chip athletes (4 &amp; 5 star players), and a higher BC ratio, than teams ranked 6-10.  

\-Notre Dame has a higher average player rating than all but the top 5 teams (ND average rating is 91.16, right behind #5 Clemson at 91.17 and #4 Texas A&amp;M at 91.20).

\-ND is ranked lower despite the above two points because of how 247 values players:  top-tier athletes, ie 5-star players, get a higher skewed point total.  ND has only one 5-star athlete on the team this year.  Every team ranked in the top 10 has at least 5 (with the exception of Oklahoma with 3).

\-Top 3 teams (Bama, Georgia, Ohio State) are clearly a tier above everyone else.

\-ND's prior year talent rankings:  #10 in 2022; #12 in 2021; #8 in 2020; #14 in 2019; #10 2016-2018; #8 in 2015

\-ND's BC ratio is currently 72.15%.  Previous years:  64.6% in 2022; 52.9% in 2021; 54.1% in 2020; 56.6% in 2019; 53% in 2018; 56.8% in 2017; 63.3% in 2016; 66.7% in 2015 (note that 2015 was the highest BC ratio in recent history before this year).  

\-This is the initial posting of 247's team talent rankings -- expect this to change slightly through the year as they update their numbers.  Some things seem wrong with their data.

2023-09-01,1693594460,ACC expansion,"Not the most 2023-team-focused discussion on gameday eve, but has anyone officially stated how or if the expansion affects ND schedule for ACC?  So far none of the articles I have seen go into detail about it, if mentioned at all.  If it is addressed please share and ignore my thoughts.

Many assumptions from ND and external are that the deal stays at 5 and Stanford will take a slot every year.   Meaning there are 16 teams for 56 remaining slots instead of 14 for 70.  I'm not sure that's something the ACC schools would accept, as that is 1 and a half fewer games for each existing ACC school over 14 years - unless they are truly too stupid or inept.

Keeping the scheduled games as is would seem to be an easy ask and a natural place to land.  The 5 ACC plus Stanford (or possibly alternate Stanford and Cal).  That way ND plays 6 ACC games, so the conference gets 14 extra games (7 in their package), so the conference gets extra.  ND gains by improving ties to Stanford/Cal through other relationships and keeps the status quo in FB.

Is the obvious easy answer that makes the most business sense for all involved, as far as I can see, something everyone else is missing?  Or am I missing something?",notredamefootball,6,6,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/167fnas/acc_expansion/,college,NA

2023-08-29,1693313575,My First Game!," 

G'day fellow Irish fans!

This Saturday vs TSU will be my first Irish game! It's been a long time coming! I've been a fan since 1996 when my O-line coach in high school gave me the nickname Rudy! I didn't know who Rudy was until I rented the movie that weekend. I was hooked! Best movie ever, am I right?!?

Anyways, I will be going to the game with me, myself, and I! A solo trip!

I'm just finalizing getting my hotel room (Candlewood Suites Mishawaka) and getting my single ticket (likely a low row in section 21 or around row 35 in section 22).

Any tips for this first timer? Is that a decent hotel? Is section 21-22 good sections? High row or low row? Anything I should do on the Friday? (Likely getting to South Bend at around 11-12pm) Anything I should do for gameday? Best parking lot? Should I purchase a parking spot before I go?

So many questions!!

Thanks, Irish fans!!

I seem to recall Brian Kelly trying this and getting similarly bad results, then going back to live tackling. I don't care what drills the team does, there's no substitute for practicing the real thing. You can't practice flag football, then expect to win at tackle football. 

Football is a contact sport. Half the defense looks like they're afraid of contact. The other half makes contact but tackles too high or doesn't wrap up. There are a few exceptions, notably numbers 47 and 13. I hope I'm wrong, but I have a gnawing fear that the OSU will exploit Freeman's flawed practice strategy.",notredamefootball,48,6,0.59,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/16p4lh0/no_live_tackling_in_practice/,college,NA

2023-09-20,1695168885,Notre Dame vs Ohio State Talent Breakdown by Position,"We made it to Ohio State week!  

Per the [247 Team Talent rankings for 2023](https://247sports.com/season/2023-football/collegeteamtalentcomposite/), Ohio State comes in as the 3rd most-talented roster in the country.  10x 5-stars and 63x 4-stars.

Notre Dame comes in ranked at #11, with 1x 5-star and 56x 4-stars.

Both teams will be facing the most talented rosters they will see the entire season.  No holding back in this one.

Here is a breakdown of recruit ratings per player, with the average of each position group shown.  I used projected depth charts for each team (ie not then entire 85-man rosters).  Where appropriate, I tried to use transfer rating vs recruit rating (247 Composite ratings).

From a raw ratings standpoint, Ohio State is higher at every single position.  But obviously an imperfect analysis.  For example -- if Joe Alt was properly rated, that would put ND's average OL score above Ohio State.

My family and I are making the trip from Cleveland to visit South Bend and attend the game Saturday. This game means so much to me and to my family. I was named after my grandfather who went to Notre Dame and passed away before I was born, and my mother went to St. Mary's College before marrying a Buckeye dropout. My grandmother still tells me stories of the days when she would go visit my grandfather and the amount of trouble he would cause at the stadium during Irish football games. Although his academic prowess didn't pass onto me to allow me the ability to attend ND, I have his same football passion for the Buckeyes. I know he will be watching from above this Saturday and I can only imagine the banter we would exchange if he was in the seat next to me at Notre Dame Stadium. 

We will be tailgating, and I look forward to interacting with a lot of you. Any do's and do not's are well appreciated, especially the sarcastic ones. Keep an eye out for Jolly Roger. . .

On the defensive side, ND will have no more than 3 sacks but will limit CMU to less than 300 yards total offense. The secondary will have two picks, one by Bertrand.

2023-09-27,1695827695,When is the last time we were actually good,"Proud 1989 grad here& I'm a third generation ND graduate. No place better in the world. Attended nearly 80% of home games since I was a child. But I have to get something off my chest. Please follow along& rant and rage with me. (It's part of being an ND fan if you haven't learned yet).

The knee-jerk reaction to this is as follows: we have made the CFB playoff since it's inception, a feat many cannot claim. Sure? Just finish up high school. Keep holding your shoulders high because we put ourselves on a stage with Alabama and got embarrassed& again? I don't quite understand that logic.

Here's my point& name a consequential game notredame has won? We lost to Cincinnati& CINCINNATI, (2021) a team that couldn't move the ball past half field against Alabama& Sure we won against Clemson last year (2022) after losing to Marshall and Stanford& then followed that win against Clemson squeaking a 3 point victory out against Navy& some called an identity game (excuse for mediocre performance). We lost to Clemson and Alabama in 2020& sorry got smacked by Alabama and Clemson in 2020. Got smacked by Michigan and lost to Georgia in 2019. 

But just wait& THE MIGHTY SEASON OF 2018& we figured it all out after losing to UGA, Miami, and Stanford the year before. We went undefeated dude what are you talking about? 30-3 loss against Clemson in the playoff is what I'm talking about. Wake up. 

2016? 4-8 because apparently we are incapable of beating Stanford.

2015? Losses to Clemson, Ohio state, and guess who? STANFORD. 

2014? 8-5 with a loss to North Western& Georgia tech of the big ten except for the fact that they are worse. 

2013? 4 losses& one coming from who other than Stanford. 

2012? THE MIGHY FIGHTIN IRISH GO UNDEFEATED!! *except for our embarrassing performance to bama which resulted in a blowout loss to show the world we weren't ACTUALLY GOOD* (sorry I tried to say that last part as quietly)

So y'all might be thinking& come on man. We have been goooood. See when I say ACTUALLY Good I mean we win big games a respectable amount, don't fall to trap games, and win against Stanford. See teams that are ACTUALLY good find a way to win. Teams that are actually good don't put 10 people on the field during the most important play of the game. This season isn't over yet& but we lost to an Ohio state offensive centric team 17-14& Hartman (who if you listened to any media outlet you would think is Jesus himself) threw for a measly 175 yards. We lost to a team that didn't and hasn't looked good all season (familiar territory I know).

2023-09-27,1695800484,Coaches vs top 10 teams plot.,"I made a post earlier this week about Freeman in comparison with the first 5 games vs top 10 opponents.  A commenter gave me an idea to make a visualization.  This is ALL top 10 opponent games for each coach, not just first 5 games like my earlier post.

[Winning Percentage and Delta Score vs Top 10 opponents.  Color is percentage of all  games \(that had poll\) that are vs top 10 teams.  Gold = higher percent, Blue = Low percent, Gray = about average ](https://preview.redd.it/pbvzq4p02rqb1.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f267e4d79d615e838e88fd571dab3ddcc6896baf)

Higher is better Delta Score and better winning percentage is to the right.  Upper right is best lower left is below average.

What I see is the clear difference between the greats (excluding Rockne who coached pre-poll era) and everyone else, with Leahy being almost off the chart.

Yes, Kelly is in with the mediocre pack, the better among them, sure, but clearly there.  This matches the perception of some ND fans.  Willingham has the fourth best winning percentage, but his delta score is the worst - so he is the ""sucked but also lucked"" outlier.

Freeman is currently an obvious outlier, his winning percentage is low (through 5 games), but the delta score is almost on par with the greats, certainly closer to them than the mediocre coach pack.  I guess the question is if his delta is buoyed by one magical game vs Clemson and he'll sink down to the mediocre area, or if he will start winning more games and his plot point will move right with more wins.",notredamefootball,14,27,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/16te902/coaches_vs_top_10_teams_plot/,college,NA

2023-09-25,1695655235,This one hurts more because...,"I have had a few days to stew about the OSU game.  In many ways, this one hurts more than most of their past games because in the past, ND was normally the lesser of the two teams.  Their game plan was to hang around until the fourth quarter and hope for a lucky break.  Sometimes that sorta worked (USC '05, Clemson '15, Georgia '17 and '18, OSU '22, etc).  

This game was different, though.  ND was good enough to go toe-to-toe with OSU for 4 quarters.  They weren't hoping to keep it close and hope for a lucky break. 

Some thoughts:

1. People are pissy about Schrader missing a 47-yard field goal.  It's unreasonable for people to expect him to make 100% of his field goals.  Maybe he's a bad kicker, maybe he isn't.  Your opinion of him should not be based on this one kick.
2. MF said that they plan on going for it on 4th and 1 inside the 50 every time.  If that's the case, I am really disappointed in the play calling on the two plays.  That QB sneak was not a good play call.  If you are planning to go for it on 4th and 1, then I am expecting you to have a good plan ahead of time for these play calls.   These calls seemed like they didn't have a plan ahead of time.
3. The second half of the game felt a lot like the Clemson game from 2022.  Offensively, ND was imposing their will on the OSU defense.  They were playing bully ball and it was working.  Ryan Day is a jackass for talking shit about Lou Holtz after the game, especially since his team was soft in this game. 
4. People are unhappy about a lot of the play calling.  In their last offensive drive, I really hate the play call on first down the most.  OSU was selling out against the run at that point and a slow-developing run play is just asking for a 5-year loss.  I have mixed feelings about the screen on 2nd down because if it hits... the game is OVER.  That said, if they run a QB sneak there for zero yards... OSU has to call a time out and they probably wouldn't have had enough time to score on their final drive.  I don't like playing woulda/coulda/shoulda... but if everything else is the same except that OSU doesn't have a time out... they lose this game because there would have a been a 10-second run-off on the 3rd and 19, which would have left 5 seconds on the clock... which means that would have been the last play of the game.
5. The new clock rules really screwed ND in this game.  Not counting the kneel down at the end of the half or the hook-and-lateral at the end of the game (i.e., possessions without any chance of being successful), there were an odd number of drives in the first half (OSU getting the ball first) and an even number of drives in the second half (ND getting the ball first).  With the old clock rules, ND would have had two more drives (albeit with the two-minute drill) and this made a difference.  As it is, OSU had an extra drive in the first half, one in which they kicked a field goal.
6. I really really hate the defensive call on 3rd and 19 at the end where they rushed 3 guys and dropped 8 guys.  My rationale for hating this play call is that OSU has great receivers who are really good at catch 50-50 balls.  When you make this call, you are conceding the QB plenty of time to find an open receiver, but you are hoping there isn't an open receiver.  Even if there isn't an open receiver, the QB would have made a throw to a GREAT receiver who could make a play.  I would have preferred rushing at least four if not five guys on this play.
7. It'll be interesting to look back at this game at the end of the year.  I don't see OSU going undefeated considering that both Penn State and Michigan look really good.

Make no mistake, we WILL win these games in the future. I've been waiting for 15 years. I know many of you have been waiting much longer.

My mom got her first gameday experience, she grew up in Ohio and went to OSU for a bit then an OSU satellite campus.  She had a blast!

OSU band at halftime was dope, didn't appreciate that they moved the turf in a way that left signs of script Ohio in the turf...  but as a fan of the sport I appreciated getting to see TBDBITL live and do script Ohio.

Wristbands needed to be brighter to be more effective, they were useless at kickoff and kinda meh with their limited brightness.  Light show was still fun though, shout out Obi for making another appearance, flyover was great, the sideline lady does a good job.

Overall everything was awesome except the last couple seconds of game clock.

2023-09-24,1695578144,What would you do?,"Curious to get a read on how other fans would have dealt with our situation in the stands during yesterday's game&

We were two Ohio State fans sitting towards the top of the south end zone, amongst a good mix of Irish and Buckeyes. But we sat directly in front of and next to a total of five ND guys, partially drunk, in two separate groups who would not let up on some really off-putting commentary about just about everything, including the following:

- The most concerning was the frequent use of a gay slur. My partner and I are gay, engaged, and enjoy going to games together. Nothing was directed towards us, but the amount of times the word was just casually dropped had my blood boiling. 
- Several negative comments about my clothing. Not my OSU jersey, but my shorts (apparently being too short for their taste)
- Jesting about the East Palestine, OH train derailment 
- Comparing the ND track and field highlights to those of Bruce Jenner in an obvious attempt to make fun of their gender identity 
- Making fun of the appearance (haircuts, height, age) of a couple of people a few rows ahead of us (ND fans)
- Several comments comparing Lou Holtz's age (and needing someone to help him on/off the field) to Joe Biden. Have your politics, fine. But is it necessary to bring it up in a setting where we're all just trying to have a good time?

Our strategy throughout the game was to ignore everything being said. And I'm in no way suggesting ND fans are classless, homophobes, transphobes, or really anything, as every large fan base is bound to have a few bad apples.

But last night was more than what's acceptable for me in public&really just bad vibes all around, and I'm genuinely curious if others have experienced something similar before, particularly with people who more than likely will not stand to reason. If so, what did you do or not do? We're not a confrontational pair, and we're not willing to escalate the situation.

Spindler hit the blocks he needed to (mostly)
Sneed finally looked like the linebacker we're hoping for. 

Negatives:
The coaches need to get their shit together, on key plays. We can all armchair coach it to death though. 
Players need to not make mental errors etc..

A couple points:

* The only coaches to have winning records were Parseghian (3-2) and Leahy (4-1).
* Every coach won at least once
* Willingham was awful, despite the win in his first game, next 4 were all losses by 30+
* Brennan was almost as bad, he won his first 2, then lost next 3 by 30+ points each
* While Freeman is 1-4, there are reasons for encouragement.
   * His Delta score is better than everyone except Parseghian and Leahy.  And very similar to Holtz's.
   * Every single coach has at least one 12-point or greater loss, expect Freeman.  Leahy is the only other coach without a 3-score loss in the bunch.
   * Four coaches have a 21-point or greater win - Leahy, Brennan, Parseghian (twice), and Freeman
   * This is the 19th HC game for Freeman and 5th top 10 opponent.  Only Holtz had coached fewer games at ND before facing fifth top 10 opponent (12th game), excluding twice interim Devore.  Holtz's 6th top 10 opponent was game 22  - Freeman's 6th will likely be game 22 as well.

The game was incredible despite the outcome. I'm not allowing one minute to destroy the entire game for me. Everyone makes mistakes kickers miss, interceptions are dropped, nobody is perfect. Notre Dame fielded a good team and played a great game that ultimately ended in defeat. Hindsight is 20/20. College football is supposed to be enjoyable and something I love. A last second loss isn't going to take that away from me. A win would have been flat out amazing but I'm not letting a loss in the final seconds turn it into the end of the world. I'm done allowing myself on this emotional roller coaster. We're a great team that lost in the final seconds to another great team. Human error comes into play every game, at every level.

2023-09-24,1695568840,"I know that I'm coping to the utmost extent, but&","Hypothetically of course: 

Would you take the OSU win if it ensured we would lose one other game sometime throughout the year? 

Pick your poison on who that loss is to. Is it a let down next week to Duke? Do we take clemson too lightly during their apparent down year? Usc and Caleb run all over us again? Upset loss to someone else?

Doesn't really matter.

Or bite on that loss to OSU but run the table the rest of the way? 

So obviously can't guarantee any of these outcomes but hypothetically we know a couple things about college football and the politics behind it:

1. Early losses &gt; late losses come selection time doesn't even matter to whom sometimes

2. It is incredibly difficult to go 12-0 in college football. Which is why college football is exciting. Upsets have happened weekly and will continue every week until the season ends. Very few if any teams will do it.

3. OSU is a massive lost opportunity for signature win, but the loss essentially doesn't hurt us. It was a sloppy game but close and competitive and all viewers know both teams are good regardless.

4. If we won the media would be stroking us. Yea they love to kick ND when they're down, but they love the hype Machine and capitalize on the hate boner 50% of ppl have for notre dame when they're good. So we don't worry about getting cocky with the hype like Colorado. 

5. Teams been humbled but still knows it's very good and made some bad miscues that easily could flip the result. Now they are motivated and focused to show who they are and get another chance at OSU or whoever beats OSU?

So yes overall the loss sucks but could benefit us from here on out in slightly copium induced subjective ways.

2023-09-22,1695426915,Am I wrong to say Audric Estime is the best back we've had since Jerome Bettis?,"So right off the bat, I want to just point out that I'm 31 years old and far too young to have watched Bettis in real time during his college career. (I remember him fondly as an NFL player though)

But I was born and bred into this ND life and my dad had dvds of games and even full seasons of all the great/ favorite teams. So I've seen Bettis in college action. 

I think estime is the best since him (though I do think Watters and Brooks are right there as well). But I honestly firmly believe Audric is far more talented and has a potentially higher ceiling.

I ran this by my father who typically scoffs at any such thing about recent players but even he has said he's special and very much in that tier. Which gives me more validation to propose it here.

We've had plenty of good ones even in my lifetime but none that just pop like him. A lot of our most talented backs don't have the stats and production,  whether because of talent around them or coaching, etc. It's been so long since we've had that premier bonafide number 1 back with the tangible production to back up the talent. 

Some of my favorites of more recent years would be:

Julius Jones
Darius Walker
Josh adams 
Theo Riddick
Ryan Grant
Jonas Gray

Julius Jones is def super underrated and in terms of pure individual talent one of the best we've had. Just had some bad teams around him. But I think Estime surpasses even him in terms of just having the full package. Which for me is very high praise since I LOVED JJ.

Edit: just because a lot of people mentioned it, yes I'm an idiot for forgetting Kyren Williams he's fantastic (especially pass blocking) and as a fantasy football guy it's even more embarrassing because he's on my team too.",notredamefootball,66,39,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/16ppgiv/am_i_wrong_to_say_audric_estime_is_the_best_back/,college,NA

2023-10-17,1697586359,"How bad has ND's Offense been? Since Ohio State, ND is ranked #127 of 133 FBS Teams when it comes to converting on Third Down...","To be a good football team, you need to get first downs.  Some teams get first downs a lot without ever getting to third down.  But the best teams right now are grinding out time of possession with long drives and consistently converting on 3rd down.  Air Force, Georgia, and Michigan have the highest 3rd down conversion rates in college football this year -- and of course they are all undefeated.

Over the past 3 games, ND's third down conversion rates have been atrocious.  Out of 133 teams in the FBS, ND has ranked 127 over the past few weeks with an average conversion rate of only 23.7%.  That adds up to a lot of punts.

Against Duke, ND converted only **3 of 15** first downs (20%).  Woof.  6 Total Punts.  The average distance on 3rd down was 8.86 yards.  Hard to be good on third down when you're literally getting less than 2 yards on first and second down combined...

Against Louisville, ND converted **3 of 13** first downs (23.1%).  Only 4 punts in this game -- though obviously there were some desperation 4th down attempts towards the end.  Average distance on 3rd down was 7.62 yards.

Against USC, ND converted **3 of 10** first downs (30%).  5 punts in this game.  Average distance on 3rd down was 5.2 yards.  Don't let the final score fool you.  ND's offense was pretty abysmal in this game too, against one of the worst defenses in college football.

How many 3rd downs will ND convert against Pitt?  Will the Irish break through and get more than 3?

Navy:  5 of 7 (71.4%)

Tenn St:  9 of 11 (81.8%)

2023-10-13,1697188496,Offensive line,"Per usual our offensive line was overrated going into the season. With that being said, offensive coordinator needs to make adjustments. in tough road environments the opposing  defensive line will have an extra edge. 

Rewatching the Louisville game sickened me. 

Blake fisher& cmon man, this guy was so highly touted, but seems he hasn't improved his game to the level that it needs to be. He's been my biggest disappointment so far. 

Back to my first point, Parker needs to make adjustments. I feel like he wants to showcase his skills as a coach in terms of the plays and schemes, but he is to slow to make adjustments when things aren't working. Hartman doesn't have all the time in the world. 

I want to see quick screens, tunnel screens, draw plays, slants, quick out routes. Too many times Hartman drops back and pressure comes. Even when he has all the time in the world, we need to make it easier on the receiving corps, Hartman, and the offensive line. 

The offensive line has been thrust into an offense in which they are incapable of holding their own. That's fine, it's what we have to work with this season. 

Halfway through the season we need to see adjustments, or Parker needs to be gone. He can showcase his skills elsewhere. Notre dame is a Win Now program year in and year out. I do not want to go back to mediocrity, and that starts one game at a time. 

Dominate our opponents. Don't make silly errors. Execute. And most importantly, be prepared. If you go into a road environment for a prime time game, make the adjustments necessary to make it easier for your college football players. 

Let me know what else our team needs to do to finish this season with success in the comments. I'm genuinely curious what everyone else has to say about the adjustments we need to make.

2023-11-08,1699476325,1964 National Title,"Does anyone have any documentation about why Notre Dame doesn't claim a national title in 1964?

As background, Alabama won the AP and Coaches titles that year. Back then those titles were awarded before bowl games were played, when Alabama was 10-0-0. They went on to lose the Orange Bowl to Texas.

The Grantland Rice Trophy (awarded by the FWAA) went to Arkansas, who was also 10-0-0 at the end of the regular season (had handed Texas their only loss) and went on to win the Cotton Bowl to finish 11-0-0. To that point in history, the FWAA was the only NCAA-recognized championship ""major selector"" to award after bowl games.

But there was a 4th major selector at the time: the NFF, which awarded a national championship ""MacArthur Bowl."" That one went to 9-1-0 Notre Dame at the end of the regular season, in spite of a season-ending 3-point loss to 7-3-0 USC on the road (the Irish played no bowl game that year).

Of course Alabama or Arkansas would have been a more obvious choice, but it's not unprecedented for major selectors to choose teams with inferior numerical records, either before or after 1964. The NFF had co-equal status as a selector that year along with the AP, Coaches, and FWAA. And I'm not aware of any other case in CFB history of a program declining to claim national champion status in a season when they were awarded the MacArthur Bowl, which was awarded annually from 1959 on.

I can't find any information online about this puzzling decision by the university. But for those who care about CFB history, it feels pretty important, given that it separates Notre Dame from Ohio State in ""poll-era"" major NCAA-recognized titles, representing the difference between sitting in 2nd place alone with 9 total (behind Alabama with 13), or tied with the Buckeyes at 8.",notredamefootball,10,20,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredamefootball/comments/17qv6ff/1964_national_title/,college,NA

2023-10-26,1698352757,Tailgate first timer,"Hi all! Thanks in advance for any tips. Three friends and myself are visiting from out of state for ND v Pitt this weekend. First timers and we are pumped! We are getting in very late Friday and then plan to Uber/get dropped off early Saturday morning so we don't need to mess with parking. Any tips on a good drop off location? Preferably one where we could hang out for a bit or tailgate for a few hours before checking out the campus. 

We thought about bringing a small foam cooler along if we find a lot to hang out in, but is that frowned upon if not parking? Backup plan is to check out the morris inn tailgate or just walk around the south lots and Eddy street bars. Feedback welcome, because we are newbies!
