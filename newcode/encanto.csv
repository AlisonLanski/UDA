1,1,Action,OVER BLACK...
1,2,Action,"WE HEAR the sounds of nighttime in a COLOMBIAN CLOUD FOREST: birds, insects, nature. Then the voice of an older woman, warm, nurturing and intimate..."
1,3,ABUELA ALMA,Abre los ojos... open your eyes....
1,4,Action,"FADE UP ON: The closed eyes of five-year-old MIRABEL MADRIGAL; light of a CANDLE reflects in her over-sized, green- rimmed glasses. Mirabel opens one eye, then the other to find a wondrous, MAGICAL CANDLE rippling with firelight magic."
1,5,YOUNG MIRABEL,This is where our magic comes from?
1,6,ABUELA ALMA,"Mm-hmm, this candle holds the miracle given to our family."
1,7,YOUNG MIRABEL,How did we get a miracle?
1,8,Action,"Alma pulls Mirabel onto her lap and the light of the candle grows. As Alma speaks, we dissolve to her as a young woman, along with her husband, PEDRO, and their THREE BABIES. The CANDLE burns brightly nearby."
1,9,ABUELA ALMA,"Long ago, when my three babies had just been born, your Abuelo Pedro and I were forced to flee our home."
1,10,Action,Strong light grows outside Young Alma and Pedro’s window. Alma and Pedro look concerned.
1,11,Action,Match to: Young Alma and Pedro (holding the candle) leading a frightened group of displaced people. They struggle across a beautiful RIVER.
1,12,ABUELA ALMA,"And though many joined us, hoping to find a new home... we could not escape the dangers... and your Abuelo was lost."
1,13,Action,"The candle flickers and Pedro looks back from where they came, troubled. Pedro hands Abuela the candle as he throws his arms out protectively as... marauders approach. As they advance, Pedro vanishes into the wind in front of Abuela, who collapses... and we push in on the CANDLE."
2,1,ABUELA ALMA,But in our darkest moment... we were given... a miracle.
2,2,Action,"As Abuela cries, we burst out of our impressionistic history into the SPLENDOR of a MIRACLE, rooted deeply in MAGICAL REALISM. The CANDLE blossoms with a magical intensity, banishing the darkness."
2,3,ABUELA ALMA,The candle became a magical flame that could never go out and it blessed us with a refuge in which to live. A place of wonder...
2,4,YOUNG MIRABEL,An Encanto...
2,5,ABUELA ALMA,An Encanto.
2,6,Action,"Around Abuela and her babies (and displaced people), MOUNTAINS rise, forming a protected VALLEY. The CANDLE shines brightly, enveloping ABUELA ALMA, its magic glows from the earth and a HOUSE grows around her."
2,7,ABUELA ALMA,"The miracle grew... and our house, our casita itself, came alive to shelter us."
2,8,Action,"The House COMES TO LIFE, to the delight of the babies."
2,9,ABUELA ALMA,"When my children came of age, the miracle blessed each with a magic gift to help us. And when their children came of age..."
2,10,Action,"The triplets turn five and as they STEP TOWARD GLOWING DOORS, they too are filled with MAGIC. As they “grow-up,” a new generation is born, and as these children are filled with magic, the series of doors becomes a mural-like family tree."
2,11,YOUNG MIRABEL,They got magic too.
2,12,ABUELA ALMA,That’s right... and together our family’s gifts have made our new home... a paradise.

3,4,YOUNG MIRABEL,"(solemn, nodding) Make my family proud."
3,5,Action,"Mirabel nods, solemn but bursting with pride. Abuela beams. As fireworks explode, the magical House knocks a CLOCK toward them, nudging that it’s time to start the ceremony."
3,6,ABUELA ALMA,"Yes, yes, Casita, we’re going."
3,7,Action,"The House brings Mirabel her shoes. She giggles, then helps Abuela to the door, holding her hand, excited and nervous."
3,8,YOUNG MIRABEL,What do you think my gift will be?
3,9,Action,"Abuela Alma bends down to Mirabel, full of love and pride."
3,10,ABUELA ALMA,"You are a wonder, Mirabel Madrigal. Whatever gift awaits, will be just as special as you."

4,1,Action,"Mirabel is now 15, though we don’t yet see her face. As she hurries around her room in tight shots, the HOUSE tries to keep up. We see some of Mirabel’s personalized decorations: self-painted wallpaper, family picture, books, etc."
4,2,Action,"Mirabel grabs a “self-decorated” dress off a sewing table. Mirabel jumps and as she lands, the House scrambles to put SHOES under her feet. Barely made it!

17,1,MIRABEL,"No, I actually made these as a surprise - for you-- (REALIZING IT’S ON FIRE) ooo--"
17,2,Action,"As Mirabel holds up the doily, it smolders. Abuela sighs."
17,3,ABUELA ALMA,"Mirabel, I know you want to help. But tonight must go perfectly. The whole town relies on our family, on our gifts. So the best way for... some of us to help is... to step aside, let the rest of the family do what they do best. Okay?"
17,4,Action,"Abuela looks at Mirabel with a tight-lipped smile, an awkward beat. Mirabel nods, wanting to be a team player."

18,4,Action,"TWO TINY HANDS pop out from under the bed, grab the present and disappear below. Smiling, Mirabel scootches under the bed and joins ANTONIO (5). Mirabel sees he’s anxious, plays it slow, treats him like a cohort instead of a little kid."
18,5,MIRABEL,Nervous? (off his nod) You have nothing to worry about. You’re gonna get your gift and open that door... and it’s gonna be the coolest ever. I know it.
18,6,Action,Antonio thinks about this.
18,7,ANTONIO,What if it doesn’t work?
18,8,MIRABEL,Well... in that impossible scenario... you’d stay in here in the nursery... with me. Forever. And I’d get you all to myself.

19,3,MIRABEL,"But alas, I am going to miss having the world’s best roomie..."
19,4,Action,"She gestures to the present. Antonio opens it, revealing... a HAND-KNITTED JAGUAR in the style of Mirabel’s dress."
19,5,MIRABEL,"I know you’re an animal guy. And I made this, so when you move into your cool new room you always have something to snuggle with."
19,6,Action,The earnestness of the moment is gently cut as the House moves its floorboards to draw their attention to the time.

19,13,Action,"People sing and cheer, lighting fireworks and holding candles as they make their way toward CASA MADRIGAL. Yes, the last ceremony didn’t go well, but it’s been ten years and the TOWN is putting their hopes on this night being a success."
19,14,Action,EXT. CASA MADRIGAL - FRONT DOOR - SAME
19,15,Action,"As the crowds arrive at the House, Luisa is the VALET, taking people’s donkeys and moving the donkeys to the “parking area.” CAMILO, changes sizes so that he can look at each person entering and shake hands with them face-to-face."
20,1,LUISA,Here yah go.
20,2,CAMILO,"Oye, Osvaldo! / Hola Señora. / Cecilia, up top!"
20,3,Action,The HOUSE takes people’s hats as they head through the archway. LUISA walks by with a platter of food as kids climb on her. ISABELA showers guests with flower petals. Mariano admires her from afar. Antonio’s door catches the attention of two kids. They rush up the staircase which suddenly becomes a slide. The children laugh and run up it again.
20,4,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - LATER
20,5,Action,"Mirabel walks Antonio to the foyer, which is sort of “back stage” from where his ceremony will begin. Pepa, Félix, Camilo and Dolores see Antonio and cheer."
20,6,FÉLIX,There you are!
20,7,PEPA,"(tearing up) Look at you, all grown up --"
20,8,Action,"As Pepa tears up, a cloud forms and starts to rain."
20,9,FÉLIX,"Pepi, you’re gonna get him all wet."
20,10,Action,Camilo transforms himself into a tiny version of Félix.
20,11,CAMILO (AS FÉLIX),You make-a your Papá proud.
20,12,FÉLIX,I don’t sound like that.
20,13,CAMILO (AS FÉLIX),“I don’t sound like that.”
20,14,Action,Dolores tilts her head and listens to a sound we cannot hear.
20,15,DOLORES,Abuela says... it’s time.
20,16,Action,"Pepa bends down to Antonio, kisses him."
20,17,PEPA,We’ll be waiting at your door!
21,1,FÉLIX,"Okay, okay, vamo, vamo, vamo--"
21,2,CAMILO (AS FÉLIX),"“Okay, okay, Vamo, vamo, vam--” -- (yanked away by Félix) - alright I’m done!"
21,3,Action,"As Félix yanks Camilo out, we focus on Mirabel watching Antonio. We can see Mirabel’s anxiety beginning to bubble. Drums play and we find Abuela standing in the courtyard, holding the MAGIC CANDLE. She is anxious as well."
21,4,ABUELA ALBA,"Fifty years ago, in our darkest moment, this candle blessed us with a miracle."
21,5,Action,"We find older members of the crowd nodding along. Over this, we also find Mirabel listening... the words triggering memories of her own gift day."
21,6,ABUELA ALMA,"And the greatest honor of our family has been to use our blessings to serve this beloved community. Tonight, we come together once more as another steps into the light... to make us proud."
21,7,Action,"The crowd cheers and the “curtains” open to reveal Antonio. He freezes, too scared to move."
21,8,Action,"The House encourages Antonio, but he won’t budge. Antonio turns to Mirabel, hand outstretched, asking for help. Mirabel looks to Abuela, whose rules for tonight are clear, then back to Antonio, torn."
21,9,MIRABEL,I can’t...
21,10,ANTONIO,I need you.
21,11,Action,"Antonio motions to Mirabel again. Mirabel wonders if she can do this... if she has the strength to step out and face the reminders of the worst night of her life. Then, as everyone watches, Mirabel steps out and takes Antonio’s hand. SHE IS GOING TO “WALK HIM DOWN THE AISLE.”"
21,12,MIRABEL,Come on. Let’s get you to your door.
22,1,Action,"The family, the town and Abuela see Mirabel join Antonio. We clock Abuela looking anxious. But Antonio holds Mirabel’s hand tightly, he needs her... and they begin to walk."
22,2,Action,"With every step, it gets harder for Mirabel... the memory of walking to her own door still so fresh in her mind - we intercut with moments of her ceremony as a five-year-old."
22,3,Action,"Mirabel looks to the MAGIC CANDLE in Abuela’s hands. As they climb the stairs to Antonio’s glowing door, every step is a painful reminder. We intercut with the moment Mirabel’s door vanished. This is the moment everyone’s expectations of Mirabel changed... when Abuela looked at her differently... when Mirabel looked at herself differently."
22,4,Action,"But Mirabel pushes through the pain of those memories and helps Antonio reach his door, handing him off to Abuela."
22,5,ABUELA ALMA,Will you use your gift to honor our miracle? Will you serve this community and strengthen our home?
22,6,Action,"Antonio nods and Alma gestures to the door. Will it work? Mirabel sees Antonio worry for just a moment, but then... as he touches the doorknob, he is FILLED WITH MAGIC! And... a TOUCAN lands on Antonio’s arm and chirps. Like it’s SAYING something to him. Antonio smiles, delighted."
22,7,ANTONIO,"(happily surprised) Uh-huh, uh-huh, I understand you. (off the toucan’s squawked response) Of course they can come!"
22,8,Action,And then DOZENS OF ANIMALS/BIRDS flock to him... and his door FORMS INTO AN ANIMAL MENAGERIE. HE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ANIMALS! Abuela is overjoyed and hugely relieved.
22,9,ABUELA ALMA,WE HAVE A NEW GIFT!!
22,10,Action,People cheer and fireworks go off and...
22,11,Action,INT. ANTONIO’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
22,12,Action,"Antonio’s new, magical room opens to reveal... an enormous CHOCÓ RAINFOREST. Animals race through the crowd. We see the three kids from the opening enter."
22,13,LITTLE ALEJANDRA,It’s bigger on the inside?!
23,1,Action,"But as the kids gawk, ROOAR! A JAGUAR races past and to Antonio’s delight, the jaguar scoops him up onto his back and races through the room - every kid’s dream come true."
23,2,FÉLIX,"WEPA ANTONIO! Vaya, vaya."
23,3,Action,"As the jaguars picks up speed, it playfully roars at Antonio."
23,4,ANTONIO,You wanna go where?!
23,5,Action,"The Jaguar races UP a tree trunk, tossing Antonio in the air."
23,6,ANTONIO,Wooooaaah!
23,7,Action,"He bounces across hammocks of COATIS and skates on the surface of a RIVER, using a SNAKE as a rope, having the time of his life! Everyone watches as this introverted kid hollers with delight!"
23,8,ANTONIO,Woooo-hoooo!
23,9,Action,"The jaguar and Antonio stop near the family. Félix celebrates and the Jaguar leaps onto Agustín, nearly knocking him over. Mirabel watches, relieved for Antonio... but the moment turns as... Abuela hurries over to Antonio, proud and relieved and pulls him in for a hug, her eyes full of pride."
23,10,ABUELA ALMA,I knew you could do it... a gift just as special as you.
23,11,Action,The words pierce Mirabel’s heart... avoiding her feelings is no longer possible. She’s so alone... and unworthy... watching her family she feels she is not truly a part of.
23,12,ABUELA ALMA,"We need a picture! Everyone, come come, come, come, come! It’s a great night, it’s a perfect night. Everyone together:"
23,13,FAMILY / EVERYONE,LA FAMILIA MADRIGAL!
23,14,Action,"As everyone cheers... POOF! The brilliant light of a magnesium flash, sends us into... SUPER SLOW MOTION. As we capture the family’s celebration, we push toward Mirabel... who watches in the shadows from the side, trying to keep it together... and failing..."
24,1,MIRABEL,"(singing) DON’T BE UPSET, OR MAD AT ALL..."
24,2,Action,PARTY GOERS STREAM PAST MIRABEL IN SLOW-MO...
24,3,MIRABEL,"DON’T FEEL REGRET, OR SAD AT ALL..."
24,4,Action,THE FAMILY CIRCLES AROUND ABUELA.
24,5,MIRABEL,"HEY, I’M STILL A PART OF THE FAMILY MADRIGAL..."
24,6,Action,MIRABEL TRIES TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD THE FAMILY.
24,7,MIRABEL,"AND I’M FINE, I AM TOTALLY FINE I WILL STAND ON THE SIDE AS YOU SHINE..."
24,8,Action,"Mirabel stands... trying to be strong, singing to her family, but:"
24,9,MIRABEL,"I’M NOT FINE, I’M NOT FINE..."
24,10,Action,"As Mirabel faces her reality, she finally tells us how she really feels."
24,11,MIRABEL,(singing) I CAN’T MOVE THE MOUNTAINS I CAN’T MAKE THE FLOWERS BLOOM I CAN’T TAKE ANOTHER NIGHT UP IN MY ROOM WAITING ON A MIRACLE
24,12,MIRABEL,"I CAN’T HEAL WHAT’S BROKEN CAN’T CONTROL THE MORNING RAIN OR A HURRICANE CAN’T KEEP DOWN THE UNSPOKEN INVISIBLE PAIN ALWAYS WAITING ON A MIRACLE, A MIRACLE..."
24,13,Action,Mirabel leaves Antonio’s room and starts walking down a hallway. Everything is still in slow-mo. Mirabel walks past magic doors.
25,1,MIRABEL,ALWAYS WALKING ALONE ALWAYS WANTING FOR MORE LIKE I’M STILL AT THAT DOOR LONGING TO SHINE LIKE ALL OF YOU SHINE
25,2,Action,Mirabel sings in front of Abuela’s door. It transforms into Abuela holding the candle.
25,3,MIRABEL,ALL I NEED IS A CHANGE ALL I NEED IS A CHANCE ALL I KNOW IS I CAN’T STAY ON THE SIDE OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES...
25,4,Action,Recreations of her family’s gifts begin to rise.
25,5,MIRABEL,I WOULD MOVE THE MOUNTAINS MAKE NEW TREES AND FLOWERS GROW SOMEONE PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW WHERE DO I GO? I AM WAITING ON A MIRACLE A MIRACLE
25,6,Action,Mirabel sings as a House of light forms. She opens the glowing entrance doors back to the courtyard where the family is standing excited to see her. Welcoming her.
25,7,MIRABEL,I WOULD HEAL WHAT’S BROKEN SHOW THIS FAMILY SOMETHING NEW WHO I AM INSIDE SO WHAT CAN I DO? I’M SICK OF WAITING ON A MIRACLE HERE I GO...
25,8,MIRABEL,"I AM READY! C’MON, I’M READY! I’VE BEEN PATIENT AND STEADFAST AND STEADY! BLESS ME NOW AS YOU BLESSED US ALL THOSE YEARS AGO WHEN YOU GAVE US A MIRACLE"
25,9,Action,"As this really rings out... we find Mirabel in the courtyard, looking up at the candle. Her reality returning... she knows her dream is a fantasy."
26,1,MIRABEL,Am I too late for a miracle...?
26,2,Action,"Mirabel stands in the lonely silence of the now empty courtyard, when... CLANK - a ROOF TILE FALLS into the courtyard next to her, breaking."
26,3,Action,"Curious, Mirabel picks up the broken tile from the courtyard... as she inspects it, she CUTS HER HAND on its sharp broken edge."
26,4,MIRABEL,Ow --
26,5,Action,"As she winces, she notices something on the courtyard tiles below her... a tile MALFUNCTIONING... fritzing in its place. Mirabel looks at it... confused. She reaches out her hand..."
26,6,MIRABEL,Casita...?
26,7,Action,"Mirabel reaches toward the fritzing tiles when... CRACK! A small crack on the floor tiles begins to form. What the hell? Mirabel recoils, afraid. CRACK CRACK! The crack splinters. Growing! Around Mirabel and the entire courtyard. They spread, rippling everywhere! Up the stairs!"
26,8,Action,"As the tiles keep fritzing, Mirabel races after the growing cracks... which ripple past PEDRO’S PORTRAIT to the second floor. Mirabel loses the path for a moment, but hears cracks down the hall. She looks just in time to see the cracks pass ISABELA’S DOOR, nearly extinguishing its magic."
26,9,Action,"Mirabel moves faster, following the disturbing cracks past Luisa’s door... Isabela’s door... and continue toward... ABUELA’S DOOR and... the MAGIC CANDLE!"
26,10,Action,"As the cracks swirl and multiply, the candle grows dimmer and dimmer! Mirabel watches in horror, it’s like the whole house grows dark and as the cracks expand around Mirabel, we push in on her terrified expression and -- SMASH TO:"
26,11,Action,INT. ANTONIO’S RAINFOREST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
26,12,Action,"In Antonio’s room, the party of all time is peaking. On the dance floor, Pepa dances with Antonio and Félix, who pulls Abuela Alma up to dance and we see a glimmer of her fun side."
26,13,FÉLIX,"Come on, Abuela! Tirame un paso -- Wepa!"
26,14,Action,"But just as Abuela lets her guard down, Mirabel bursts in!"
27,1,MIRABEL,THE HOUSE IS IN DANGER! THE HOUSE IS IN DANGER!
27,2,Action,"Everyone stops and looks at her, the band stops their music. Abuela stares at Mirabel, concerned."
27,3,MIRABEL,(out of breath) The tiles were falling and there were cracks everywhere and... the candle almost went out.
27,4,Action,People in the party begin to murmur uncomfortably. Abuela clocks this and looks to Mirabel.
27,5,ABUELA ALMA,Show me.
27,6,Action,EXT. CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
27,7,Action,"Mirabel leads the family to the candle and presents them with... nothing, no cracks, the candle shines brightly."
27,8,MIRABEL,"What? No, that’s --- the cracks were there, they were... everywhere. The house was in trouble, the, the candle was..."
27,9,Action,"Isabela looks at Mirabel and scoffs. Abuela looks at the candle, then back to Mirabel, embarrassed and disappointed."
27,10,MIRABEL,"Abuela, I promise -"
27,11,ABUELA ALMA,That’s enough.
27,12,Action,"As nervous whispers build within the crowd, Abuela gives a pointed look to Mirabel, then puts on her “face of confidence” and turns to address the crowd."
27,13,ABUELA ALMA,"There is nothing wrong with La Casa Madrigal. The magic is strong... and so are the drinks! Please -- music! A bailar, a bailar!"
27,14,Action,"Agustín, realizing how awkward this is for Mirabel, motions to Luisa, who brings him a PIANO, which he plays to smooth- over the weirdness. Isabela looks at Mirabel and scoffs."
28,1,Action,"As people head back into the party, Julieta approaches Mirabel, concerned."
28,2,Action,INT. KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
28,3,Action,"As sounds of the party continue, Julieta prepares an AREPA."
28,4,MIRABEL,"If it was all in my head, how did I cut my hand? I would never ruin Antonio’s night. Is that really what you think?"
28,5,JULIETA,What I think is that today was very hard for you-
28,6,MIRABEL,"That’s (not)- (then) I was looking out for the family. And I might not be super-strong like Luisa, or effortlessly perfect like “Señorita Perfecta” Isabela, who’s never even had a bad hair day. But... (SIGHS) Whatever..."
28,7,Action,"The House delivers an arepa to Julieta, who moves to Mirabel."
28,8,JULIETA,"I wish you could see yourself the way I do. You are perfect, just like this. You’re just as special as anyone else in this family."
28,9,Action,"Mirabel hears the words... but before they can land, Julieta holds Mirabel’s hand and heals her."
28,10,MIRABEL,Mm-hm. You just healed my hand with an arepa con queso.
28,11,JULIETA,"I healed your hand... (playful) ...with my love for my daughter, with her wonderful brain--"
28,12,Action,Mirabel tries to wriggles away from Julieta’s affection.
28,13,MIRABEL,Agh.
29,1,JULIETA,--big heart--
29,2,MIRABEL,Stop.
29,3,JULIETA,--cool glasses--
29,4,MIRABEL,Mamá.
29,5,Action,Julieta gives Mirabel a big embarrassing kiss on the cheek.
29,6,JULIETA,"Ay, te amo, cosa linda."
29,7,Action,"But though Julieta tries to snuggle up to Mirabel, Mirabel is not won over, and extricates herself."
29,8,MIRABEL,I know what I saw.
29,9,Action,Julieta sighs.
29,10,JULIETA,"Mira, my brother Bruno lost his way in this family... I don’t want the same for you. Get some sleep. You’ll feel better tomorrow."
29,11,Action,"Off Mirabel’s unresolved feelings, we jump to:"
29,12,Action,INT. MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
29,13,Action,Mirabel stares at the ceiling - there’s NO WAY she’s sleeping. And there’s no way she made it all up.
29,14,Action,"- QUICK FLASH REMEMBERING THE CRACKS, THE DIMMING CANDLE."
29,15,Action,"Frustrated, Mirabel climbs out of bed, opens her door and looks up to the candle where the wall was covered in cracks."
29,16,Action,EXT. ABUELA’S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER
29,17,Action,"Mirabel rubs her hand along the stucco wall of Abuela’s window... no cracks... but as she stares, confused... she hears a noise... it’s ABUELA. She’s upset... vulnerable. Mirabel’s never seen her like this. Abuela steps to the window and opens her chatelaine to a portrait of Pedro."
30,1,ABUELA ALMA,"Ay, Pedro... I need you. Cracks in our casita... If our family knew how vulnerable we truly are... if our miracle is dying. We cannot lose our home again."
30,2,Action,Tears are welling up in Abuela’s eyes now.
30,3,ABUELA ALMA,"Why is this happening? (then) Open my eyes. If the answer is here, help me find it. Help me protect our family. Help me save... our miracle."
30,4,Action,Abuela turns and heads back into her room.
30,5,Action,"We push in on Mirabel, if there was any doubt that she needed to act, it’s gone. The cracks were real, she’s not crazy, she needs to help Abuela, she needs to save the magic, save the family. Mirabel stares at the candle."
30,6,MIRABEL,I will save the miracle.
30,7,Action,INT. MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
30,8,Action,"SMASH! Mirabel busts into her room, grabs her dress, grabs her bag, puts on her shoes. Energized, she goes to her door, grabs the handle, the music builds bigger and bigger and... RECORD SCRATCH."
30,9,MIRABEL,(to the House) Wait. How do I save a miracle?
30,10,Action,"The House pantomimes back, it has no idea. Mirabel thinks for a moment."
30,11,MIRABEL,"(lightbulb) I figure out what’s happening to the miracle. (OFF THE HOUSE) Oh, I have no idea, but there is one person in this family who hears everything about everything..."
30,12,Action,"Mirabel looks at a picture of her family, and zeroes in on... DOLORES, her cousin who hears everything."
31,1,Action,EXT. OUTSIDE PATIO - MORNING
31,2,MIRABEL,"....so if anyone would know what’s wrong with the magic, it’s her."
31,3,Action,"Several AREPAS are picked up by... DOLORES, who is stacking her plate with food. She looks oddly nervous. Behind her, Mirabel enters and locks on target."
31,4,MIRABEL,"(like it’s not weird) Dolores, hey. You know, out of all my older cousins, you’re like my favorite cousin, so I feel like I can talk to you about anything, ergo you can talk to me about anything, like the problem with the magic last night that no one seemed to worry about, but maybe you heard about that maybe I should know about."
31,5,Action,"Behind them is FÉLIX, who stands with THE REAL DOLORES."
31,6,FÉLIX,Camilo! Stop pretending you’re Dolores so you can have seconds.
31,7,Action,"The “DOLORES” near Mirabel, morphs back into “Camilo.” The House takes his food back and whacks his hand."
31,8,CAMILO,Worth a shot. Ah! Ey!
31,9,Action,The REAL DOLORES whispers in Mirabel’s ear.
31,10,DOLORES,"The only one worried about the magic is you... and the rats talking in the walls...(BIZARRE, A BEAT) oh, and Luisa. I heard her eye twitching all night."
31,11,Action,"A lightbulb goes off in Mirabel’s head. She looks over at Luisa, who is carrying a table over with one hand."
31,12,LUISA,There we go.
31,13,Action,"But as Mirabel heads for Luisa, Abuela Alma enters."
32,1,ABUELA ALMA,"(agitated) Everyone to the table. Let’s go, let’s go --"
32,2,Action,Mirabel takes Pepa’s seat so that she can sit next to Luisa.
32,3,MIRABEL,Luisa--
32,4,ABUELA ALMA,"Family, we are all thankful for Antonio’s wonderful new... gift..."
32,5,Action,"Abuela goes to her chair, but finds COATIS in it."
32,6,ANTONIO,I told ‘em to warm up your seat.
32,7,Action,"Antonio smiles to Abuela, who manages a smile back."
32,8,ABUELA ALMA,"Thank you, Toñito. I’m sure today we’ll find a way to put your blessings to good use.... (trailing off, O.S.) ...as must we all, we are the caretakers of this Encanto..."
32,9,Action,"As Abuela continues, Mirabel leans over to Luisa."
32,10,MIRABEL,"Luisa, Dolores says you’re totally freaking out, any chance you maybe know something about last night, with the magic - (off Luisa) You do!"
32,11,Action,"Mirabel pounds the table, excited."
32,12,ABUELA ALMA,Mirabel.
32,13,Action,"Mirabel looks up, busted by Abuela, for talking while Abuela was giving a speech."
32,14,ABUELA ALMA,If you can’t pay attention I will help you.
32,15,MIRABEL,"Actually, I--"
33,1,ABUELA ALMA,Casita?
33,2,Action,"The House MOVES Mirabel next to Abuela, away from Luisa."
33,3,ABUELA ALMA,"As I was saying, we must never take our miracle for granted, so today, we will work twice as hard."
33,4,MIRABEL,"(trying to go to Luisa) Mhmm, I will help Luisa --"
33,5,Action,"Mirabel stands to go back to Luisa, but Abuela continues."
33,6,ABUELA ALMA,"Stop. First, an announcement. I’ve spoken to the Guzmans about Mariano’s proposal to Isabela. Dolores, do we have a date?"
33,7,DOLORES,(listens “to town”) Tonight. (LISTENS) He wants five babies.
33,8,Action,Isabela nervously sprouts some flowers.
33,9,ABUELA ALMA,"Wonderful, such a fine young man with our perfect Isabela (PLUCKS OUT WRONG FLOWERS) will bring a new generation of magical blessings and make both of our families stronger."
33,10,Action,"Camilo morphs into a snarky version of MARIANO, Isabela swats him with flowers to get him to stop."
33,11,CAMILO,(as Mariano) Mmmm. (Makes kissy sounds) Ay!
33,12,ABUELA ALMA,"Okay, our community is counting on us, La familia Madrigal!"
33,13,MIRABEL/ FAMILY,-- La Familia Madrigal!
33,14,MIRABEL,Luisa hey --
34,1,Action,"As everyone gets up, Mirabel sees Luisa is gone. Mirabel heads after Luisa and -- SMACKS into Isabela, sending petals everywhere."
34,2,ISABELA,(calling after) What is your problem?!
34,3,MIRABEL,"(calling back) Ugh, sorry - (O.S. impact) - Hey Luisa! Hold up!"
34,4,Action,EXT. ENCANTO - TOWN - A LITTLE LATER
34,5,Action,We find Luisa MOVING A CHURCH. The Priest “blesses her.”
34,6,SRA. OSMA,"Luisa, can you re-route the river?"
34,7,LUISA,Will do!
34,8,SR. RENDON,"Luisa, the donkeys got out again."
34,9,LUISA,On it.
34,10,Action,"As Luisa picks up a COUPLE OF DONKEYS, Mirabel awkwardly climbs over the stone wall behind her."
34,11,MIRABEL,"(calling after) Luisa, wait a second --"
34,12,Action,"Luisa looks back, sees Mirabel, moves faster."
34,13,MIRABEL,You gotta tell me about the magic. What’s going on? What are you hiding?
34,14,LUISA,"Nothing, just gotta lotta chores, so maybe you should just go home."
34,15,SR. FLORES,"Luisa, my house is leaning to the-- oh!"
34,16,Action,Luisa knocks a crooked house straight and keeps walking.
35,1,MIRABEL,"Dolores said your eye was twitching and it never twitches, something’s making you nervous --"
35,2,LUISA,"Hey move, you’re gonna make me drop a donkey."
35,3,MIRABEL,Luisa?! Will you just-- Just tell me what it is!
35,4,LUISA,There’s nothing to tell --
35,5,MIRABEL,"You’re obviously worried about something! Luisa, if you know what’s hurting the magic and it gets worse ‘cause you won’t tell me what’s wrong --!"
35,6,LUISA,NOTHING’S WRONG!
35,7,Action,"The DONKEYS are like, “YIKES.” Mirabel’s like “whoa.” Luisa realizes, tries to play it off."
35,8,LUISA,"Wow, uh, sorry, that, uh, that snuck out there... what I meant was... “why would anything be wrong?” I’m totally fine. The magic’s fine. Luisa’s fine. I’m totally not nervous."
35,9,Action,"As Luisa smiles, trying to be casual, her eye twitches."
35,10,MIRABEL,Your eye is... doing the thing...
35,11,Action,"Unwilling to admit there’s a problem, Luisa gets in Mirabel’s face."
35,12,LUISA,"(singing) I’M THE STRONG ONE, I’M NOT NERVOUS, I’M AS TOUGH AS THE CRUST OF THE EARTH IS"
35,13,Action,"Luisa smashes a boulder to underscore her toughness. A beat. Mirabel stares at Luisa, what the hell is happening?"
36,1,MIRABEL,Okay...
36,2,LUISA,"I MOVE MOUNTAINS, I MOVE CHURCHES, AND I GLOW, CUZ I KNOW WHAT MY WORTH IS"
36,3,Action,Another little beat. The donkeys behind Mirabel back up.
36,4,MIRABEL,"Course I mean -- (TO DONKEYS) hey, where are you going?"
36,5,Action,"Luisa approaches Mirabel, intense."
36,6,LUISA,"I DON’T ASK HOW, HARD THE WORK IS, GOT A ROUGH, INDESTRUCTIBLE SURFACE. (gaining momentum!) DIAMONDS & PLATINUM, I FIND ‘EM, I FLATTEN ‘EM, I TAKE WHAT I’M HANDED, I BREAK WHAT’S DEMANDED, BUT..."
36,7,Action,"Luisa rips up the ground, sending them both into a fantasy song space where Luisa’s insecurities are on full display."
36,8,LUISA,"UNDER THE SURFACE I FEEL BERSERK AS A TIGHTROPE WALKER IN A THREE RING CIRCUS UNDER THE SURFACE WAS HERCULES EVER LIKE “YO, I DON’T WANNA FIGHT CERBERUS?”"
36,9,Action,"Mirabel suddenly finds herself battling Cerberus, only to be saved by Luisa."
36,10,LUISA,UNDER THE SURFACE I’M PRETTY SURE I’M WORTHLESS IF I CAN’T BE OF SERVICE A FLAW OR A CRACK THE STRAW IN THE STACK THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK WHAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK? IT’S...
36,11,Action,"We’re suddenly on a stage, where Luisa shows her vulnerable side as... donkeys cascade all around them."
37,1,LUISA,"PRESSURE LIKE A DRIP DRIP DRIP THAT’LL NEVER STOP, WHOA... PRESSURE THAT’LL TIP TIP TIP TIL YOU JUST GO POP, WHOA..."
37,2,LUISA,"GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER, YOUR SISTER’S OLDER GIVE HER ALL THE HEAVY THINGS WE CAN’T SHOULDER WHO AM I IF I CAN’T RUN WITH THE BALL IF I FALL TO"
37,3,Action,Suddenly they fall into a GIANT COFFEE BEAN PRESS.
37,4,LUISA,"PRESSURE LIKE A GRIP GRIP GRIP AND IT WON’T LET GO, WHOA... PRESSURE LIKE A TICK TICK TICK TIL IT’S READY TO BLOW, WHOA..."
37,5,Action,"Luisa helps Mirabel escape the coffee bean press, only to find themselves in a field of geysers."
37,6,LUISA,"GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER, YOUR SISTER’S STRONGER SEE IF SHE CAN HANG ON A LITTLE LONGER WHO AM I IF I CAN’T CARRY IT ALL, IF I FALTER"

37,8,LUISA,"UNDER THE SURFACE I HIDE MY NERVES, AND IT WORSENS, I WORRY SOMETHING IS GONNA HURT US UNDER THE SURFACE THE SHIP DOESN’T SWERVE. HAS IT HEARD HOW BIG THE ICEBERG IS?"
37,9,Action,"The mountains part, and we are suddenly on the deck of the Titanic as an iceberg looms."
37,10,LUISA,UNDER THE SURFACE I THINK ABOUT MY PURPOSE. CAN I SOMEHOW PRESERVE THIS? LINE UP THE DOMINOES A LIGHT WIND BLOWS (MORE)
38,1,LUISA,YOU TRY TO STOP IT TOPPLIN’ BUT ON AND ON IT GOES
38,2,Action,"Luisa and Mirabel are sucked up into a tornado, sending them into a beautiful sky, with pink clouds and not a care in the world. As Mirabel listens, she gains a whole new appreciation of what Luisa has been feeling all of these years."
38,3,LUISA,"BUT WAIT, IF I COULD SHAKE THE CRUSHING WEIGHT OF EXPECTATION WOULD THAT FREE SOME ROOM UP FOR, JOY? OR RELAXATION OR SIMPLE PLEASURE INSTEAD WE MEASURE... THIS GROWING PRESSURE KEEPS GROWING, KEEP GOING CUZ ALL WE KNOW IS..."
38,4,Action,"Just as Luisa lets herself relax, giant boulders fall from the sky and Luisa catches them before they crush Mirabel."
38,5,LUISA,"PRESSURE LIKE A DRIP DRIP DRIP THAT’LL NEVER STOP, WHOA PRESSURE THAT’LL TIP TIP TIP TIL YOU JUST GO POP, WHOA"
38,6,LUISA,"GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER, IT DOESN’T HURT AND SEE IF SHE CAN HANDLE EVERY FAMILY BURDEN WATCH AS SHE BUCKLES AND BENDS BUT NEVER BREAKS"
38,7,Action,"THE ENTIRE MADRIGAL HOUSE LANDS ON LUISA, CRUSHING HER. Mirabel can’t believe it, but... suddenly Luisa lifts the house up from below. She’s not giving in!"
38,8,LUISA,"NO MISTAKES! JUST PRESSURE LIKE A GRIP GRIP GRIP AND IT WON’T LET GO, WHOA PRESSURE LIKE A TICK TICK TICK TIL IT’S READY TO BLOW, WHOA"
38,9,LUISA,"GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER, AND NEVER WONDER IF THE SAME PRESSURE WOULD’VE PULLED YOU UNDER (MORE)"
39,1,LUISA,"WHO AM I IF I DON’T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES (THEN) NO CRACKS, NO BREAKS! NO MISTAKES! NO PRESSURE!"
39,2,Action,"BOOM! The song ends. Mirabel looks at Luisa, stunned. Luisa stares back like a dancer who just finished an insane routine and still breathing heavy."
39,3,Action,BACK TO REALITY:
39,4,Action,They stand in a weird silence. And instead of saying anything... Mirabel simply... HUGS LUISA.
39,5,MIRABEL,I think you’re carrying way too (GETS SQUEEZED) much.
39,6,Action,"Emotional, Luisa picks Mirabel up and hugs her too hard."
39,7,LUISA,Maybe I over do it.
39,8,MIRABEL,(getting squeezed) Yup.
39,9,LUISA,"Um, there is something you should know: last night, when you saw the cracks, I felt... weak."
39,10,Action,Luisa finally lets Mirabel breathe.
39,11,MIRABEL,"Wha- What, what, what?!"
39,12,SR. RENDON,"Luisa, the donkeys!"
39,13,LUISA,On it!
39,14,MIRABEL,"Wait, wait, wait - what do you mean? What do you think’s hurting the magic?"
39,15,Action,"Luisa picks up a donkey, she has to hurry, she pulls Mirabel close to tell her a secret."
40,1,LUISA,"Don’t know. But I heard the grown ups once: before Tio Bruno left, he had like some terrible vision about it."
40,2,MIRABEL,Tio Bruno? What was in his vision?
40,3,LUISA,"No one knows, they never found it. But if something’s wrong with the magic, start with Bruno’s tower, find that vision."
40,4,Action,"Luisa heads off, carrying more donkeys."
40,5,MIRABEL,"(calling after) Wait, how do you “find” a vision?! What am I even looking for?"
40,6,LUISA,"If you find it, you’ll know. But be careful... that place is off limits for a reason."
40,7,Action,Mirabel turns back to the House... to Bruno’s tower.
40,8,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - A LITTLE LATER
40,9,Action,"On her way to Bruno’s door, she sneaks past Isabela and Abuela Alma."
40,10,ABUELA ALMA,Such a perfect match.
40,11,ISABELA,So perfect.
40,12,ABUELA ALMA,And so good for the Encanto.
40,13,Action,Mirabel sneaks past the two and reaches Bruno’s door. No one’s been in there for years.
40,14,Action,INT. BRUNO’S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER
40,15,Action,"Mirabel shoves open Bruno’s door, revealing a dusty, dark ante room. In front of her, sand spills in from above, creating a curtain of sand, beyond which she can’t see."
41,1,MIRABEL,"Casita, can you turn off the sand?"
41,2,Action,Nothing happens. Mirabel looks back where she can see the floor tiles at the doorjamb say “the house cannot help beyond this point.” The gravity of this hits Mirabel.
41,3,MIRABEL,You can’t help in here?
41,4,Action,"The House responds “no... and I’m worried about you,” after all, Mirabel has never been “without the House.”"
41,5,MIRABEL,"I’ll be fine. I need to do this, for you, for Abuela... maybe a little for me. (looks to sand) Find the vision, save the mir-ack!"
41,6,Action,As Mirabel steps through the “sandfall” she...falls!
41,7,Action,INT. BRUNO’S TOWER - CONTINUOUS
41,8,Action,Mirabel falls face first and slides down a giant sand dune. She looks up to see... she’s in towering room.
41,9,MIRABEL,Whoa...
41,10,Action,"Widen to reveal a SIGN reading “Your Future Awaits,” which points to the TOP of the cavern. HUNDREDS OF STAIRS lead all the way up. As Mirabel looks up - FLIT-FLIT-FLIT... Antonio’s TOUCAN flaps down next to her. It smiles and squawks “hello.”"
41,11,MIRABEL,"Oh, hello. (THEN) Lotta stairs, but at least I’ll have a friend-- (the toucan flies away) no, you flew away immediately."
41,12,Action,Mirabel watches it fly to the top. She’s on her own. Mirabel grits her teeth and starts climbing.
41,13,MIRABEL,Alright.
41,14,Action,"As she goes, we pop forward in time, and with each little pop, she gets more tired and is soon wheezing and struggling."
41,15,MIRABEL,(talk-singing) Welcome to the Family Madrigal... (MORE)
42,1,MIRABEL,"(NEXT POP)...there’s so many stairs in the Casa Madrigal... (NEXT POP) you would think there’d be another way to get so high cause we’re magic, but no -- magical, how many stairs fit in here! Bruno, your room is the worst!!"
42,2,Action,"Later, Mirabel finally gets to the top of the stairs, only to find there is a gap in the path. She groans, exhausted."
42,3,MIRABEL,Come on...
42,4,Action,As Mirabel takes a breath... then removes a rope railing on and throws it over a boulder above as an anchor.
42,5,MIRABEL,"Okay, I can do this. (looking at the gap) Ooo..."
42,6,Action,"Mirabel goes to swing across, slips, loses her balance, but... somehow makes it across. Stunned she succeeded, Mirabel pumps her fists --"
42,7,MIRABEL,Wooooo!
42,8,Action,"But as Mirabel stomps her foot to celebrate, the ledge below her cracks and plummets to the ground, nearly taking her with it. She looks to the toucan, who looks at her, judgmental. Deciding celebration time is over, Mirabel turns to the entrance of Bruno’s “temple.”"
42,9,Action,INT. BRUNO’S TEMPLE - MOMENTS LATER
42,10,Action,"The corridors feel like a forgotten tomb. The TOUCAN trails her, nervous. Mirabel looks around, focussing on a triptych of images depicting how Bruno’s visions come to pass. As Mirabel investigates it - SCREEE!!! She accidentally knocks a POT full of... RATS. They startle Mirabel and scurry into a RELIEF SCULPTURE OF BRUNO. On closer inspection... Bruno’s eyes have been scratched out. Disturbing."
42,11,Action,"Mirabel hears a creak, which draws her eyes to... Bruno’s “INNER SANCTUM.” It sure looks like the epicenter. The TOUCAN looks at Mirabel... turns around and flies away."
42,12,MIRABEL,Quitter.
43,1,Action,INT. BRUNO’S INNER SANCTUM - MOMENTS LATER
43,2,Action,"Mirabel enters the dark room... there’s an unusual circle of SAND in the middle, but there is no sign of anything else. It’s a dead end. Confused... she steps out onto the SAND..."
43,3,MIRABEL,Empty....
43,4,Action,"The wind moving through the cavern sucks the door shut, plunging Mirabel into DARKNESS. Mirabel panics, stuck in the darkness... but then... a light. Something glowing green... she’s standing on it... the sand itself seems to be glowing... Mirabel digs into the sand and finds... A GLOWING SHARD - LIKE A PIECE OF AN EMERALD RELIEF SCULPTURE."
43,5,MIRABEL,"(whispered, to herself) What’s hurting the magic?"
43,6,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - SAME TIME
43,7,Action,"Abuela sweeps the House, trying to clean up Isabela’s copious flower petals. But the room seems to rumble. Concerned, Abuela looks up and sees... the CANDLE flicker just a bit."
43,8,Action,INT. BRUNO’S INNER SANCTUM - SAME TIME
43,9,Action,"As Mirabel pulls more glowing emerald pieces from the sand, she realizes they form some kind of image. She realizes this is Bruno’s vision... smashed to pieces! Mirabel nervously connects the pieces to reveal... HER OWN WORRIED FACE."
43,10,MIRABEL,Me...?
43,11,Action,"RUMBLE! The entire cavern begins to shake, falling apart. Sand begins pouring in, covering the remaining shards under the sand. Panicking, Mirabel tries to dig out the remaining shards and shove them into her MOCHILA bag as the cavern quakes and CRACKS snake around the room."
43,12,Action,"As pieces of stone and sand threaten to block the entrance... Mirabel races to collect one last piece, but as she dives to the door, it’s locked! Mirabel bangs at it desperately and then... jiggles the handle. Whoosh! A tidal wave of sand pushes her out to safety, almost sending her over the cliff. Mirabel looks down at the shards... what does it mean?"
44,1,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - AFTERNOON
44,2,Action,Mirabel hurries out of Bruno’s room and turns a corner and walks right into ABUELA ALMA.
44,3,ABUELA ALMA,"Uch, where are you coming from in such a hurry?"
44,4,MIRABEL,I’m sorry. I was --
44,5,ABUELA ALMA,(seeing bits of sand) What’s in your hair?
44,6,MIRABEL,(flustered) Uh --
44,7,Action,"Is Mirabel busted? Just as Abuela begins to look suspicious... CRYING INTERRUPTS THE MOMENT! It’s the LOUD SOBBING of... LUISA, who staggers up the stairs behind them."
44,8,LUISA,My gift! I’m losing my gift!
44,9,ABUELA ALMA,What?!
44,10,LUISA,"Mirabel and I were having this little talk about me carrying too much, so I tried not to carry so much but I realized it was putting me behind and I knew I was gonna let everyone down and felt really bad so I was grabbing all the donkeys but then when I went to throw the donkeys in the barn, they were... heavy."
44,11,Action,"Luisa runs off crying. Abuela looks to Mirabel, concerned."
44,12,ABUELA ALMA,What did you do? What did you say to her?
44,13,MIRABEL,Nothing. I - I don’t--
44,14,ABUELA ALMA,Mirabel --
45,1,Action,As they sit in an awkward silence -- BELLS from town ring. Abuela looks torn.
45,2,ABUELA ALMA,"Ach, I have to go get the Guzmans for Isabela’s engagement. (torn, off Mirabel) Stay away from Luisa until I can talk to her. Tonight we can’t have any more problems. And whatever you’re doing, stop doing it!"
45,3,Action,Abuela heads off. Mirabel looks at Luisa’s door which... flickers ever so slightly.
45,4,Action,INT. MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
45,5,Action,"Shaking, Mirabel pulls out the shards of BRUNO’S VISION, trying to understand. She looks at HER FACE, staring back."
45,6,MIRABEL,"(to herself) Why am I in your vision, Bruno?"
45,7,Action,"A FLASH of LIGHTNING and THUNDER shake the room. Startled, Mirabel turns to see PEPA, frazzled, in her doorway."
45,8,MIRABEL,"(hiding the shards) Tía, jeez --"
45,9,PEPA,"(trying to shoo clouds) Sorry, sorry, I- I didn’t mean to -- shoo, shoo, shoo, -- I just wanted to get the last of Toñito’s things - and then I heard “the name we do not speak.” (a rumble of thunder, comedically dramatic) Great, now I’m thundering. And a thunder will lead to a drizzle and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle-- (to herself, a mantra) Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies--"
45,10,Action,"Pepa tries to calm herself as she picks up a few of Antonio’s remaining clothes from the room: sandals, underwear, etc. Mirabel looks at her, looks at the bag of shards."
46,1,MIRABEL,"Uh, Tía Pepa - if Bru- if he had a vision about “someone” what would it mean for them?"
46,2,PEPA,We don’t talk about Bruno.
46,3,MIRABEL,"I know, it’s just, hypothetically, if he “saw” you --"
46,4,PEPA,"-- Mirabel, please. We need to get ready for the Guzmans."
46,5,MIRABEL,I just want to know if it was generally positive... or... like less positive or--
46,6,Action,Félix barges in!
46,7,FÉLIX,It was a nightmare!
46,8,PEPA,Félix!
46,9,FÉLIX,"Ey, she needs to know, Pepi. She needs to know."
46,10,PEPA,We don’t talk about Bruno.
46,11,FÉLIX,"He would see something terrible, and then crack-ba-boom, it would happen."
46,12,PEPA,We don’t talk about Bruno.
46,13,MIRABEL,What if you didn’t understand what he saw?
46,14,FÉLIX,"Then you better figure it out, because it was coming for you!"
47,1,PEPA,"WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO, NO NO NO WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO..."
47,2,Action,"Pepa tries to get them to stop... but looks at Félix, who motions for Pepa to spill it, and suddenly... we are BACK IN THE PAST, and witnessing the day of their wedding."
47,3,PEPA,BUT! IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY
47,4,FÉLIX,IT WAS OUR WEDDING DAY
47,5,PEPA,WE WERE GETTING READY AND THERE WASN’T A CLOUD IN THE SKY
47,6,FÉLIX,NO CLOUDS ALLOWED IN THE SKY
47,7,PEPA,BRUNO WALKS IN WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN—
47,8,FÉLIX,THUNDER!!

48,3,DOLORES,"HEY - GREW TO LIVE IN FEAR OF BRUNO STUTTERING OR STUMBLING I COULD ALWAYS HEAR HIM SORT OF MUTTERING AND MUMBLING I ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THE SOUND OF FALLING SAND, CH CH CH"
48,4,Action,Dolores twirls Mirabel around and she tries to keep up.
48,5,DOLORES,"IT’S A HEAVY LIFT WITH A GIFT SO HUMBLING, ALWAYS LEFT ABUELA AND THE FAMILY FUMBLING, GRAPPLING WITH PROPHECIES THEY COULDN’T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"
48,6,Action,"Mirabel gets pulled into a creepy underground space with Camilo, who shape-shifts to add a dramatic effect to his extra creepy Bruno tale, where he BECOMES Bruno himself."
48,7,CAMILO,A SEVEN FOOT FRAME RATS ALONG HIS BACK WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME IT ALL FADES TO BLACK YEAH HE SEES YOUR DREAMS AND FEASTS ON YOUR SCREAMS

49,4,Action,"And as the spotlight turns to... ISABELA, we find ourselves back in the family courtyard, waiting to hear Isabela’s terrible story... but instead, she sings like a bird, her story as perfect as she is."
49,5,ISABELA,HE TOLD ME THAT THE LIFE OF MY DREAMS WOULD BE PROMISED AND SOMEDAY BE MINE....
49,6,Action,"Mirabel looks at Isabela, like “really, everyone has these terrible visions but you have that one?”"

51,5,ALL,DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO!
51,6,MIRABEL,WHY DID I TALK ABOUT BRUNO?!
51,7,ALL,NOT A WORD ABOUT BRUNO!
51,8,MIRABEL,I NEVER SHOULDA BROUGHT UP BRUNO!
51,9,Action,SONG ENDS. Mirabel stares at the completed VISION image which shows... MIRABEL in front of her cracked house!
51,10,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - MIRABEL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
51,11,Action,"Mirabel is horrified that the vision shows her face surrounded by cracks, but as she stares at it, panicking:"
51,12,AGUSTÍN,"Miraboo. Got your party pants on, ‘cause I do--"
51,13,Action,"Agustín stops as he pokes his head in and sees the vision. He looks to Mirabel, concerned. The HOUSE quickly and ungracefully tries to cover it up. Mirabel looks at Agustín, considers lying, but realizes she should just spill it."
52,1,MIRABEL,"(spilling out) I... broke into Bruno’s tower, I found his last vision, the family’s in trouble, the magic is dying, the house is breaking, Luisa’s gift is fading and I think it’s all because of... me?"
52,2,Action,"Agustín stares at Mirabel, stunned."
52,3,MIRABEL,Pa?
52,4,Action,Agustin eyes go wider... trying to formulate a plan. Agustín then shoves the vision into his POCKETS.
52,5,AGUSTÍN,"(smiling but panicking) We say nothing, Abuela wants tonight to be perfect, ‘til the Guzmans leave, you did not break into Bruno’s tower, the magic is not dying, the house is not breaking, Luisa’s gift is not fading, no one will know, just act normal, no one has to know."
52,6,Action,"Suddenly there’s a NOISE, and they turn to see... DOLORES all the way across the courtyard... but her eyes tell us, she has clearly heard everything that Agustín just said."
52,7,DOLORES,(whispered) I know.
52,8,MIRABEL,She’s gonna tell everyone.
52,9,ABUELA ALMA,"(sweetly, but firm) Time to eat!"

52,13,Action,"The Madrigal family, plus MARIANO and his ABUELA GUZMAN (European Spanish, judgmental) sit at the dining table."
53,1,ABUELA ALMA,The Guzmans and the Madrigals together will be so good for the Encanto.
53,2,ABUELA GUZMAN,"Yes, then let’s hope tonight is not a horrible disaster."
53,3,ABUELA ALMA,"(chuckles, then toasts) To a perfect night. Salud!"
53,4,EVERYONE,Salud!
53,5,Action,"Mirabel does her best to act normal as she maintains unwavering eye contact with Dolores, who struggles to keep the secret in... but looks like she’s gonna pop any minute."
53,6,Action,"As the Abuelas lightly chuckle (there is fun, light tension between them) Mirabel keeps staring at Dolores, willing her not to divulge the secret."
53,7,ABUELA GUZMAN,"I assumed that all was well in La Casa Madrigal...though, when it comes to my Mariano, it is always best to see for myself."
53,8,Action,"A BOWL OF AVOCADO PASSES IN FRONT OF MIRABEL, blocking her view of Dolores."
53,9,MARIANO,Avocado?
53,10,Action,"As the avocados pass, Mirabel now sees that Dolores couldn’t hold out any longer and is now telling Camilo the secret - he chokes on his food, his head changes into Mirabel then Bruno as he snarfs on the table."
53,11,ABUELA GUZMAN,La Familia Madrigal has always been a pillar of our communi...ty...
53,12,Action,Not great. Everyone looks at him - especially the two Abuelas (and Isabela). Abuela Alma doesn’t like this at all and pours more wine for Abuela Guzman to distract her.
53,13,FÉLIX,"(not in front of company) Camilo, fix your face."
54,1,Action,"Camilo looks to Mirabel, who is starting to panic that Camilo now knows her secret too, but as she tries to “stare him into keeping quiet” a PITCHER of water PASSES IN FRONT OF HER."
54,2,ISABELA,Water?
54,3,Action,"As the water jug passes, Mirabel sees that Camilo is now whispering to Félix. Félix’s eyes go wide and he chokes on some water, which flies onto Abuela Guzman’s plate."
54,4,Action,"Abuela Alma watches this, quietly panicking, trying to maintain her composure."
54,5,ABUELA ALMA,"(a little weirded-out) Mirabel, the cream, please."
54,6,Action,Mirabel smiles at Abuela and turns to Agustín for the cream.
54,7,MIRABEL,"Pa, the cream."
54,8,Action,"Reveal Agustín next to Mirabel. He tries to hand her the cream, but his hand is shaking like crazy. Mirabel takes the cream and passes it to Abuela."
54,9,Action,"Thunder draws Mirabel’s attention to... Pepa. Félix is whispering in her ear, and now a small swirling hurricane forms over the dining room table."
54,10,ABUELA ALMA,(clearly embarrassed) Pepa? The cloud.
54,11,Action,Pepa tries her best to calm herself down to shrink the cloud.
54,12,PEPA,"Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies.."
54,13,Action,"Julieta leans over to Pepa, concerned. Pepa whispers in Julieta’s ear. Julieta flushes, then looks to Mirabel, DEEPLY WORRIED."
54,14,Action,"Mirabel tries to avoid her mother’s gaze, looking at the floor to avoid eye-contact. But as Mirabel looks down... she finds... TINY CRACKS beginning to form on the FLOOR BELOW HER AND ISABELA! Are they sprouting from her?"
54,15,MARIANO,Mirabel...?
55,1,Action,"Mirabel, freaked out, sits up fast, bonking her head on the underside of the table, then pops up."
55,2,MARIANO,...everything okay?
55,3,Action,"Mirabel stares at Mariano, caught. Then..."
55,4,AGUSTIN,"Everything’s great, she’s just... excited! For you to propose, which you should do as fast as you can --"
55,5,MIRABEL,Yes!
55,6,MARIANO,"Uh, I was actually... gonna..."
55,7,MIRABEL,You were actually gonna! Great!
55,8,Action,Mirabel swivels Isabela’s chair toward Mariano. Abuela Guzman is a little weirded out.
55,9,ABUELA GUZMAN,"Well, well -- well...since everyone here has a talent, my Mariano wanted to begin with a song. Luisa, could you bring over the piano?"
55,10,Action,"Luisa, at the end of the table, moans, fighting tears. She sad marches to “get the piano” knowing she can’t lift it. As she goes, Mirabel sees the cracks spreading."
55,11,LUISA,(through tears) Okay.
55,12,MIRABEL,"Uh, it’s actually family tradition to sing after."
55,13,Action,On “AFTER” Mirabel shoves Mariano down on one knee. And motions for him to begin.
55,14,MARIANO,"(Takes a breath) Isabela, most graceful of all the Madrigals-"
56,1,Action,"As the cracks spread, the House starts to malfunction. Mirabel moves behind Mariano, shielding the family from seeing the cracks, but now awkwardly horning in on the proposal."
56,2,MARIANO,Um...
56,3,MIRABEL,You’re doing great.
56,4,Action,"Under Agustín, Mirabel sees the Coatis take the GLOWING SHARDS of MIRABEL’S VISION OUT OF HIS POCKET."
56,5,MARIANO,The most perfect flower in this entire Encanto.
56,6,Action,"Outside, Luisa tries to shove a piano, making horrible scraping noises. Abuela Guzman looks utterly confused."
56,7,MIRABEL,No --
56,8,MARIANO,...in this entire Encanto.
56,9,Action,The COATIS are almost done assembling the vision. Mirabel sees them and panics.
56,10,MARIANO,WILL YOU... MARRY ME?!
56,11,Action,"No longer able to contain herself, Mirabel lunges at Coatis."
56,12,MIRABEL,Nooo!
56,13,Action,"Luisa falls to the ground, CRYING in defeat. Toucan is frightened by Pepa’s storm cloud and goes flying over Abuela Guzman’s head who ducks just in time."
56,14,ABUELA GUZMAN,What is happening?!
56,15,DOLORES,"(blurting) Mirabel found Bruno’s vision, she’s in it, she’s gonna destroy the magic and now we’re all doomed!"
56,16,Action,"AND ON CUE, THE COATIS pull the VISION up on to the table. As Mirabel tries to snatch it, she accidentally sends it sliding down the table, stopping right in front of Abuela Alma."
57,1,Action,"EVERYONE LOOKS AT THE VISION, THEN TO MIRABEL and... CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Cracks ripple seemingly from Mirabel around the whole room and everyone’s powers fritz and spasm. The ground cracks under Isabela who (shocked) shoots a bunch of vines directly into Mariano’s face."
57,2,Action,"Pepa’s storm cloud opens up, unleashing a torrent of water onto the whole table. As animals race out, they blow open the windows where we can see the WHOLE TOWN out front, ready to celebrate."
57,3,TOWNSFOLK,FELICIDADES - (SEES CHAOS) whoa...
57,4,Action,"HARD CUT AS: the Guzmans leave, (dodging more chaos and animals) with Abuela Alma in tow, Mirabel follows into the courtyard as well."
57,5,ABUELA ALMA,"Señora, por favor!"
57,6,MIRABEL,"Abuela, please -- there’s gotta be an explanation!"
57,7,Action,Isabela stomps past Mirabel.
57,8,ISABELA,"(to Mirabel, dramatic) I hate you!"
57,9,Action,"Luisa races past Mirabel, sobbing."
57,10,LUISA,"(crying) Ahh, I’m a loser!"
57,11,AGUSTIN,Luisa!
57,12,Action,"Pepa runs out, her weather going crazy."
57,13,PEPA,(to Mirabel) What did you do?!
57,14,Action,More cracks ripple through the house.
57,15,MIRABEL,I’m not doing anything! It’s Bruno’s vision! It’s...
57,16,Action,As Mirabel says that she notices... a green light moving on the ground... It’s... a shard of the vision...
58,1,Action,"being carried by... A RAT. There are dozens of rats, all of them are taking the shards from the dining room and racing up to the balcony."
58,2,Action,Abuela chases after Abuela Guzman and Mariano.
58,3,ABUELA ALMA,The magic is strong! EVERYTHING IS FINE! We are the Madrigals! (shuts door) MIRABEL!
58,4,Action,Thunder CLAPS!
58,5,Action,EXT. CASA MADRIGAL - UPPER WALKWAY - NIGHT
58,6,Action,Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles as... Mirabel pursues the wet rats (HOLDING A SHARD) along the upper walkway. But as she turns the corner... they’re gone.
58,7,Action,"Then a noise... and she spots a single rat tail disappear through an opening under... a LARGE PAINTING. Mirabel approaches the painting... studies it... then slowly pulls it open, revealing... a PASSAGEWAY within the walls."
58,8,Action,INT. BETWEEN THE WALLS - CONTINUOUS
58,9,Action,"Mirabel climbs into the secret passageway between the walls of the house to find the inside COVERED in CRACKS, which undulate malevolently. What is this place?"
58,10,Action,"A rat SQUEAKS as it scurries past Mirabel’s feet and away into the darkness, but as its glowing shard retreats... the glow moves into the air. As Mirabel squints to get a better look, FLASH! A bolt of lightning illuminates... BRUNO, sinister and evil, who holds the shard."
58,11,Action,"Mirabel and Bruno stare at each other for an electric second. Another flash, and he turns and runs - his shadow streaking away down a distant corridor. Realizing this may be her only chance to understand Bruno’s terrible vision, Mirabel races after him!"
58,12,MIRABEL,HEY!
58,13,Action,INT. BETWEEN THE WALLS - CONTINUOUS
58,14,Action,"Mirabel races through the narrow corridors, struggling to catch up in the winding, twisting labyrinth."
59,1,Action,Shafts of light peek through the interior of the house to illuminate them as they streak by.
59,2,Action,"The rhythm of their feet creates a syncopated rhythm as they move faster and faster, sliding down unexpected drops and tight turns."
59,3,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - PEPA’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
59,4,Action,"We pop to the other side of the wall, where Camilo is trying to calm down Pepa."
59,5,CAMILO,"(sooo calming) It’s okay, Mami, deep breath in, deep breath out..."
59,6,Action,"WHAM! Something slams the wall next to them, and when Pepa hears the impact she panics, zapping Camilo with lightning."
59,7,Action,INT. BETWEEN THE WALLS - SAME TIME
59,8,Action,"As Mirabel recovers from slamming a wall, another flash illuminates Mirabel."
59,9,MIRABEL,Stop! STOP!
59,10,Action,"Mirabel is almost to Bruno, but he jumps a CHASM and it looks too far for Mirabel to follow. As Bruno disappears down a distant corridor, Mirabel summons her courage and jumps and... MAKES IT! But the floor below her gives way and she falls, barely catching herself at the last second... but only holding on by a finger. Below is a seemingly endless fall into DARKNESS."
59,11,MIRABEL,"No-no-- HELP! HELP! (desperate, to the House) CASITA?! CASITA?! (but it can’t help) HELP ME! HELP ME!"
59,12,Action,"Too late, Mirabel loses her grip and falls and -- her hand is grabbed mid-air, by... BRUNO. His face comes into the light, she sees he’s not at all what she thought... he’s small, timid... and straining."
59,13,TIO BRUNO,You’re very sweaty.
60,1,Action,"But before Mirabel can respond... the floor underneath Bruno collapses too, Mirabel grabs onto a loose board and catches Bruno. They are now both dangling from the pit. As Mirabel looks at her uncle, a rat pop from his cloak -- she startles and accidentally drops him to his death..."
60,2,MIRABEL,Oh no!
60,3,Action,"But... there’s actually floor right beneath, he’s fine, they just couldn’t see it. Bruno looks around, surprised."
60,4,TIO BRUNO,Huh.
60,5,Action,"Tio Bruno climbs up the wall boards as Mirabel helps him up. Bruno looks to Mirabel... a long beat, then:"
60,6,TIO BRUNO,Bye.
60,7,MIRABEL,"(confused, pursuing) What? No -- Hold on --"
60,8,Action,"Mirabel hurries after Bruno and follows him through a strange “back of house” tour: pipes, furniture, relics, evidence of the rooms on the other side, etc."
60,9,Action,"As Mirabel tries to keep up, she sees that Bruno is EXTREMELY superstitious, avoids WALKING UNDER A LADDER, has all kinds of good luck charms around him."
60,10,MIRABEL,"Wait, wait -- Ow -- why did you take the vision? -- what does it mean -- Is it why you came back or--"
60,11,Action,Tio Bruno passes a piece of wood.
60,12,TIO BRUNO,"Knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood."
60,13,Action,Then he crosses his fingers and holds his breath.
60,14,MIRABEL,Tio Bruno?
60,15,Action,He passes another piece of wood.
60,16,TIO BRUNO,"(tapping a wall, OCD) Knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood."
61,1,Action,Bruno uncrosses his fingers.
61,2,TIO BRUNO,"You were never supposed to see that vision, no one was -- a little salt."
61,3,Action,He throws salt behind his back.
61,4,MIRABEL,But -- (SPUTTERS ON SALT)
61,5,TIO BRUNO,Sugar. (HE TOSSES SUGAR ON HER)
61,6,Action,"And keeps walking past rows of HANGING ALOE PLANTS, then does a hop skip and a jump over a series of cracks on the ground."
61,7,TIO BRUNO,"Sana sana, colita de rana."
61,8,Action,Mirabel is about to ask a follow-up when they pass an area with TONS of cracks which have been painstakingly patched up.
61,9,MIRABEL,"Wait, have you been in here... patching the cracks?"
61,10,Action,Bruno looks up at all of the patched cracks.
61,11,TIO BRUNO,"Oh that? No, no, no, no, no, I’m too scared to go near those things. All the patching’s done by Hernando."
61,12,MIRABEL,Who is... Hernan--
61,13,TIO BRUNO,"(different voice) --I’m Hernando and I’m scared of nothing. (takes off hood, regular voice) It’s actually me. I used to say my real gift was acting. (yet another voice) I’m Jorge, I make the spackle."
61,14,Action,Mirabel stares at Bruno.
62,1,MIRABEL,(beat) How long have you been... back here?
62,2,Action,INT. BRUNO’S SECRET ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
62,3,Action,"Tight shots on rat habitrails and weird odds-and-ends of a guy who has lived behind the walls way too long. Funny, weird, gross... filled with family heirlooms and knick- knacks, quirky and oddly charming."
62,4,MIRABEL,(realizing) You never left.
62,5,TIO BRUNO,"Well, I- I left my tower, which was you know, a lotta stairs, and uh in here - (SHOWS FOOD) eh? Kitchen adjacent - ooo plus, free entertainment!"
62,6,Action,ANGLE ON: Bruno’s makeshift “RAT-THEATER” - which is basically a cardboard cut-out that he gets his rats to poke their faces through by putting food on the other side so that they unknowingly enact bizarre little plays.
62,7,TIO BRUNO,So whattya like? Whattya like? You like sports? Game Show? Telenovelas? (re: “romantic” rat) Their love could never be.
62,8,MIRABEL,(looking around) I don’t understand.
62,9,TIO BRUNO,"Well, because she’s his aunt and she has amnesia, so she can’t remember that she’s his aunt, you see it’s like a very forbidden kind of-"
62,10,MIRABEL,"I don’t understand why you “left,” but didn’t “leave?”"
62,11,Action,Bruno looks a little uncomfortable about the question.
63,1,TIO BRUNO,"(avoiding eye-contact) Oh, well... because you know the mountains around the Encanto are pretty tall... and uh - you know like I said, free food... and everything... (to the rats) Yeah, you guys, you guys love the free food, don’t ya? Always hungry, never satisfied..."
63,2,Action,"Mirabel notices a shaft of light... she follows it and peers through to discover the family DINING ROOM on the other side of the wall. She looks down to see Bruno has recreated his own version of the family table in his little room, complete with a stenciled plate. Mirabel looks back to Bruno, realizing how badly this guy still wants to be part of the family. Embarrassed, he avoids eye contact."
63,3,TIO BRUNO,"My gift wasn’t helping the family... but uh... but I love my family, you know... I just don’t know how to... I just don’t know how to..."
63,4,Action,"On that last phrase, Bruno finally looks to Mirabel. She realizes how similar they are. She’s emotional, because she always felt alone. And inferior. Bruno shifts awkwardly."
63,5,TIO BRUNO,"Well anyway, I think you should go, because um -- well, I don’t really have a good reason, but if I did, you’d be like, I should go ‘cause that’s a good reason."
63,6,Action,"Mirabel walks over to him, gently."
63,7,MIRABEL,"Why was I in your vision? Tio Bruno...? (off his look, the most honest she’s been) I just... wanted to make the family proud of me... just once. But if I should stop... if I’m hurting my family... just tell me."
63,8,Action,He looks at her... debating revealing his deep secret.
64,1,TIO BRUNO,"I can’t tell you... (SHE SIGHS, FRUSTRATED) Because I don’t know."
64,2,Action,That grabs Mirabel’s attention. Bruno takes the shards from his pocket and starts to assemble them...
64,3,TIO BRUNO,"I had this vision the night that you didn’t get your gift. (Mirabel turns, surprised) Abuela worried about the magic, so she begged me to look into the future, see what it meant..."
64,4,Action,FLASHBACK: We see the vision swirling around Bruno.
64,5,TIO BRUNO,"And I saw the magic in danger... our house... breaking... and then... and then, and then... I saw you. But the vision was different. It... it would change... and there was no one answer... no clear fate. Like your future was undecided. But I knew how it was gonna look, I knew what everyone would think because I’m Bruno and everyone always assumes the worst... so... so..."
64,6,Action,WE SEE BRUNO SMASH THE VISION... and LEAVE.
64,7,Action,"Back in the Bruno’s room, Mirabel manipulates the vision, seeing it transform from cracks spreading to cracks disappearing."
64,8,MIRABEL,You left... to protect me...?
64,9,TIO BRUNO,"I don’t know which way it’ll go... but my guess... the family, the Encanto, the fate of the miracle itself - it’s all gonna come down to you."
64,10,Action,"This is a big moment for Mirabel... a lot to process. She looks at the lenticular, adjusting it backwards and forwards. Bruno thinks for half a beat."
65,1,TIO BRUNO,"(SHRUGS) Or maybe I’m wrong. (CHUCKLES) You know, it’s a mystery, it’s a mystery that’s why this vision is (FART SOUND). (then, walks her to door) Look if I could help anymore I would but, that’s all I know. Good luck. I wish I could’ve seen more."
65,2,Action,"Bruno shuts the door, leaving Mirabel alone in the dark, hallway. She thinks about what he said..."
65,3,MIRABEL,"(nods, solemn) Yeah.... (then lightbulb) Yeah!"
65,4,Action,Mirabel barges back in!
65,5,MIRABEL,You “wish you could’ve seen more.” So see more. (SHAKING BRUNO) Have another vision!
65,6,TIO BRUNO,"Oh, uh, no, no, see, I don’t, I don’t do visions anymore."
65,7,MIRABEL,But ya could.
65,8,TIO BRUNO,But I won’t.
65,9,MIRABEL,"You can’t say “the weight of the world is on your shoulders, the end.” If our fate’s up to me, me says have another vision, maybe it’ll show me what to do --"
65,10,TIO BRUNO,"Look, even if I wanted to, which I don’t, you wrecked my vision cave, which is a problem ‘cause I need a big open space --"
65,11,MIRABEL,We’ll find one.
65,12,TIO BRUNO,Where?
66,1,ANTONIO,Use my room.
66,2,Action,"They turn around to see the TAPIR, CHIGUIRO, COATIS... and ANTONIO. He smiles."
66,3,ANTONIO,"The rats told me everything. (then, looking O.S.) Don’t eat those."
66,4,Action,"Angle on: the Jaguar, about to eat... some rats, it backs off. Mirabel looks back to Bruno."
66,5,MIRABEL,Our family needs help. (then) And you need to get outta here.
66,6,Action,Bruno looks to the rats cleaning themselves with his toothbrush... and then licking the toothbrush.
66,7,TIO BRUNO,(I see your point) Mmyeh.
66,8,Action,EXT. CASA MADRIGAL - DAY BREAK
66,9,Action,"The same kids from the beginning play in the grass in front of the Madrigal house. A crack forms on the ground next to them and they look up at the CANDLE, which flickers unnaturally. The House shakes. Weirded out, the kids run away from the House, where a GROUP of people are gathered."
66,10,Action,EXT. CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - SAME TIME
66,11,ABUELA ALMA,(to Agustín) You should have told me the second you saw the vision! Think of the family.
66,12,AGUSTÍN,I was thinking of my daughter!
66,13,Action,A GUST of wind blows snow across the room.
66,14,ABUELA ALMA,"Pepa, calm down!"
66,15,PEPA,I’m doing my best!
67,1,FÉLIX,Yes.
67,2,PEPA,You’re lucky it’s not a hurricane!
67,3,JULIETA,"Mamá, you’ve always been too hard on Mirabel."
67,4,Action,Small cracks emerge around them.
67,5,ABUELA ALMA,"Look around. We must protect our family, our Encanto. We cannot lose our home!"
67,6,Action,OLD ARTURO ENTERS FROM OUTSIDE (with a crowd from town)...
67,7,OLD ARTURO,"Señora, perdón, people in town are becoming anxious about the magic. They want to see you."
67,8,ABUELA ALMA,Mirabel was in that vision for a reason. Find her.
67,9,Action,"As Abuela leaves, the HOUSE SHAKES... and we carry that tremor into..."
67,10,Action,INT. ANTONIO’S RAINFOREST ROOM - SAME TIME
67,11,Action,"Feeling the tremor, animals fly and run off scared."
67,12,MIRABEL,We might wanna hurry.
67,13,Action,As Bruno prepares a sand circle for his vision...
67,14,TIO BRUNO,"Ya can’t hurry the future, uh..."
67,15,Action,"Bruno is making his circle of sand (pouring the sand from his bucket), and reaches the Chiguiro sitting in his path."
67,16,TIO BRUNO,"And what if I show you something worse? If I see something that you don’t like, you’re gonna be all, “Bruno makes bad things happen, oh, he’s creepy and his vision killed ma’ goldfish.”"
68,1,MIRABEL,I don’t think you make bad things happen. Sometimes family weirdos just get a bad rap. You can do this.
68,2,Action,Antonio hands Bruno a stuffed jaguar.
68,3,ANTONIO,(I’ve been there) For the nerves.
68,4,Action,"Antonio smiles at Bruno and nods, like, I believe in you, then heads off. Bruno looks at the stuffed jaguar, then up to Mirabel, considering. Then, with a weighty exhale, Bruno reaches into his ruana and takes out a handful of salt then he throws it behind his back."
68,5,TIO BRUNO,"(to himself) I can do this. I can do this. I can do this, I can do this."
68,6,Action,"Bruno lights a match, which he uses to ignite piles of wet leaves. As the smoke begins to spiral around him and Mirabel, Bruno closes his eyes... entering a trance-like state."
68,7,Action,"The magic fills the room and somewhere in the house Bruno’s door starts to glow. On the way to town, Abuela pauses at the strange occurrence, unsure of the cause."
68,8,Action,"The entire room begins to glow in the light of his eyes, wind kicks up, blowing leaves and sand that begins to SWIRL around Mirabel and Bruno, glowing brighter and brighter. Mirabel looks to Bruno who... looks at her and his eyes TWINKLE GREEN, like flecks of glitter."
68,9,TIO BRUNO,You might wanna hang on.
68,10,Action,"He squeezes her hands and energy surrounds them. (Out in the courtyard... Bruno’s door begins to spark back to life.) But we’re back inside as Mirabel gasps with wonder, as WHOOSH! Mirabel is suddenly transported into..."
68,11,Action,AN IMPRESSIONISTIC FLASH OF VISIONS:
68,12,Action,"- CHAOS in the house. The family running! (THIS IS THE PART OF THE VISION THAT BRUNO WITNESSED ORIGINALLY). Then, a SHAPE: MIRABEL... standing amidst the expanding cracks... Bruno starts to falter."
69,1,TIO BRUNO,"It’s just -- it’s just the same thing, I gotta stop --"
69,2,MIRABEL,"No, I need to know which way it goes -- there’s gotta be an answer, something we’re not seeing."
69,3,TIO BRUNO,(over the noise) You’re looking at the same thing that I am! If there was something else --
69,4,Action,"Mirabel, gets an idea... turns the opposite direction. Bruno sees her, thinks it’s pointless. Mirabel looks and... spots a glitter of gold."
69,5,MIRABEL,(holy shit) There -- over there --
69,6,Action,"Confused, Bruno turns, and it illuminates... a BUTTERFLY... flitting through chaos. Bruno can’t believe it."
69,7,TIO BRUNO,Butterfly! Follow the butterfly!
69,8,Action,"As they stand, the BUTTERFLY lands on a REED in a RIVER, Which dissolves as something begins to glow behind it."
69,9,MIRABEL,Where is that...?
69,10,Action,"The images flutter, Bruno struggles to see it..."
69,11,TIO BRUNO,It’s all outta order --
69,12,Action,"The image starts to come into focus, it’s... THE CANDLE BURNING BRIGHTER. CRACKS DISAPPEARING."
69,13,TIO BRUNO,"It’s, it’s -- it’s the candle! The candle’s getting brighter!"
69,14,Action,"NEARBY IS A SILHOUETTE OF MIRABEL IN MOTION, ARMS OUT..."
69,15,TIO BRUNO,I think you’re gonna help the candle!
70,1,MIRABEL,How?!
70,2,Action,Bruno’s vision moves... showing Mirabel and a GLOWING FIGURE. Who is it? As Mirabel wills herself to bring the figure into focus... we see the shape of a WOMAN.
70,3,TIO BRUNO,There’s someone with you! And you - you fight her!
70,4,MIRABEL,What?!
70,5,Action,Bruno squints trying to interpret what he’s seeing.
70,6,TIO BRUNO,"Wait no, no, no, no -- is that a hug?!"
70,7,MIRABEL,Am I fighting or hugging?!
70,8,TIO BRUNO,"An embrace -- AN EMBRACE! -- to make the candle bright, you have to embrace her!!"
70,9,MIRABEL,Embrace who?!
70,10,Action,The images grow more and more volatile.
70,11,TIO BRUNO,Almost there...
70,12,MIRABEL,Who is it?!
70,13,TIO BRUNO,"Almost there... I, I -- I got it!"
70,14,Action,As Mirabel steps forward... it’s... it’s... ISABELA?
70,15,MIRABEL,Isabela?!
70,16,Action,"A FLASH OF LIGHT, ENDS THE VISION, leaving us with glittering sand... which falls onto the chiguiro. Bruno looks at the new emerald vision “plate” and smiles."
70,17,TIO BRUNO,"Oh, your sister, that’s great!"
71,1,Action,Mirabel stares at it in disbelief. Bruno realizes she’s hates his vision. He chucks it like it’s garbage.
71,2,TIO BRUNO,Every time.
71,3,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - UPPER BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER
71,4,Action,"We start tight on Isabela’s door, pull back to find Bruno and Mirabel staring at it from behind a plant."
71,5,MIRABEL (PRELAP),Why would “embracing Isabela” do anything?
71,6,TIO BRUNO,"Idaknow, our family got a miracle, how do you help a family miracle? You hug a sister."
71,7,Action,"Mirabel looks at Bruno like he’s stupid. A noise below draws them to Camilo, who walks across the courtyard. Mirabel and Bruno duck."
71,8,CAMILO,(calling out) Mirabel?! Mirabel?!
71,9,Action,Camilo’s powers fritz and he gets... a baby head.
71,10,Action,"BACK TO MIRABEL AND BRUNO: Bruno looks from Camilo to the candle, which flickers. Mirabel is too busy worrying."
71,11,TIO BRUNO,"Oh, I think we’re running outta time here."
71,12,MIRABEL,"It’s not gonna work. She won’t hug me, ever, okay? She hates me. Also, I don’t know if you heard, I ruined her proposal. Plus, P.S.--"
71,13,TIO BRUNO,-- Mirabel --
71,14,MIRABEL,-- it is just annoying -- of course it’s Isabela --
71,15,TIO BRUNO,-- Mirabel --
72,1,MIRABEL,"-- and what’s her problem with me anyway, she’s the one with roses coming out her--"
72,2,TIO BRUNO,"Mirabel. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, you see you’re missing the point. The fate of the family is not up to her, it’s up to you. You’re exactly what this family needs. You just have to see it. (then, casual) By yourself, after I leave."
72,3,MIRABEL,What? You’re not coming?
72,4,Action,Bruno moves a tall potted plant -- hiding him from view as he waddles toward the portrait leading to his secret passageway.
72,5,TIO BRUNO,"(”important prophecy”) It was your vision, Mirabel... not mine."
72,6,MIRABEL,You’re afraid Abuela will see you.
72,7,TIO BRUNO,"Yep, I mean yes... that too. (then) Hey, after you save the miracle... come visit."
72,8,MIRABEL,"(smiles, then) After I save the miracle, I’m bringing you home."
72,9,Action,"Bruno gives Mirabel a smile then knocks on wood, crosses his fingers, holds his breath and tips backwards into the wall."
72,10,TIO BRUNO,Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock on wood.
72,11,Action,"After he leaves, Mirabel notices candle and magic’s glow becoming more and more erratic. Mirabel looks toward Isabela’s glowing door, psyching herself up."
72,12,MIRABEL,You got this. Just gonna save the miracle... (SO DUMB) with a hug.
73,1,Action,"With that, Mirabel heads to Isa’s door."
73,2,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - ISABELA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
73,3,Action,"Mirabel enters ISABELA’S AMAZING FLOWER ROOM. It’s a lush, Colombian flower garden, tropical and very, very PINK. Isabela is nowhere to be found. Mirabel looks around... cautiously."
73,4,MIRABEL,(super sweet) Isa? Hey!
73,5,Action,Mirabel continues through the room.
73,6,MIRABEL,(calling out) I know we’ve... had our issues... but I’m... (HATING SAYING IT) ready to be a better sister... to you... So we should just... hug... Let’s hug it out. Eh?
73,7,Action,Mirabel looks up to find... Isabela on a crazy flower bed... which looks more over-the-top than usual.
73,8,ISABELA,(menacing) Hug it out...? (then) Luisa can’t lift an empanada. Mariano’s nose looks like a smashed papaya. Have you lost your mind?!
73,9,MIRABEL,"Isa, I feel like you’re upset... and you know what cures being upset? A warm embrace."
73,10,ISABELA,Get out.
73,11,Action,"As Mirabel starts to protest, a flower pops out of the vine, covering Mirabel’s mouth."
73,12,ISABELA,"Everything was perfect! Abuela was happy, the family was happy, you wanna be a better sister, apologize for ruining my life!"
73,13,ISABELA,Go on... apologize.
74,1,Action,The room shakes catching Mirabel’s attention.
74,2,MIRABEL,(that’s a tough one) I... am... sorry... (can’t keep going) ...That your life is so great!
74,3,ISABELA,Out.
74,4,Action,"With a wave of her hand, Isabela’s vines drag Mirabel toward the door. Worried she’ll miss this important opportunity, Mirabel tries to grab onto furniture to stop her momentum."

96,14,Action,"The Madrigals and the town begin to rebuild the home. Over the next rebuilding montage, Bruno helps map out the layout of the house with his sand, Pumped Juancho chugs a bunch of coffee and nails like a fiend, and we find Mirabel, Isabela and Luisa; the three have never been this closer."
97,1,ISABELA,IT’S A DREAM WHEN WE WORK AS A TEAM. YOU’RE SO STRONG.

99,2,TIO BRUNO,WE NEED A DOOR-KNOB.
99,3,ANTONIO,WE MADE THIS ONE FOR YOU...
99,4,Action,Antonio hands Mirabel... a NEW DOORKNOB with an “M” on it. Mirabel looks up to see the family gathering around her. Antonio takes Mirabel’s hand and walks her toward the front door. People in town begin to join as well.

99,12,MIRABEL,I see... me... (then) All of me.
99,13,Action,"Mirabel looks to her family, who all smile back. Mirabel turns, then places HER doorknob into the FRONT DOOR of the House and... WHOOSH! AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT races over the entire Encanto, restoring its magic... and redefining the cracks that spread to the entire town. A new miracle."
99,14,Action,"As the House comes back to life once more, the House “waves” at Mirabel and she waves back."
99,15,MIRABEL,"Hola, Casita."
100,1,Action,"As Mirabel waves, the house zips her through the front doors into the home. Mirabel looks back to her family and the gathering crowd from town."
100,2,MIRABEL,"C’mon, get in here!"
100,3,Action,The House yanks everyone else into the House too and they cheer and celebrate.
100,4,Action,INT. CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
100,5,Action,Mirabel enters the courtyard to see everyone’s doors glowing with a NEW kind of magic. The doors are unformed... gifts no longer set in stone.
100,6,Action,"Antonio rides past on his JAGUAR. Isabela creates new, bizarre plants, transforming herself away from expected “perfection.” Luisa regains her strength, but the donkeys (under Antonio’s supervision) carry her to a hammock to relax with a beverage. Snow begins to falls overhead and we pan over to Pepa who is dancing under her snow cloud with Félix."
100,7,Action,"Watching all of this is Mirabel, Bruno and Abuela Alma who are suddenly... yanked off screen by the House, which grabs the entire family, placing them for a NEW FAMILY PORTRAIT. The House slides over the camera and one of Bruno’s rats snaps a picture as..."

100,9,Action,"The Casita squeezes this whole, imperfectly perfect family together."
