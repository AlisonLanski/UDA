Last time, it was Christmas trees in the same location (stalking/pressuring people   charging too much). As we left the pumpkin parking lot, I realized the family name looked familiar. Never again.  First they charge $3 per person to get inside, just to buy pumpkins? Maybe it's ok because it's like a mini fair? But we just wanted a few pumpkins.  Inside, no prices posted for any pumpkins, none at all. Knowing that was a risky indicator, and dressed a bit too nice after a work meeting, sure enough the woman at the front seemed make up prices for the pumpkins. Absurd prices. Almost laughed in her face   walked out but I didn't, and I should have. That's on me.  The family running these lots feel like ""carnies"", but maybe that's unfair to actual carnival workers?   P.S. I heard two families saying the tickets for the kid rides were expensive. I hope the T Family doesn't rip off everybody as bad as they did me. "

So my sweet little toddler was bouncing in a house and someone came in and told me we couldn't bounce if we didn't pay. By then we were so over it we decided to leave and My toddler started crying because she didn't understand why she couldn't bounce. $10 for a mediocre pumpkin but wanted to let my toddler pick one out.

Carnies are specifically the people who work the ride and games section of a fair or festival. The carnival is usually a large business that has multiple large contracts going at any given time. When you go to a fair the carnival is owned by one company. No carnie owns the booth or ride they are operating.  They usually travel with the carnival from event to event.  And don't make much money. The grifts and sale tactics are not set by them. It's company policy.  Most of them certainly don't have the time or money to set up a pumpkin patch.   So these types of things are just your usual grifters and not carnie specific.

The first challenge your soul must endure is the parking lot. You wait with your vehicle half blocking traffic, creating a perfect circular vortex of anger that encompasses the street and the entrance to the store.   Once you attain access to the lot, you discover that this is a false achievement; other motorists stop and start with no apparent thought or plan  turns once begun are quickly abandoned, the drivers seemingly immune to geometry. At last a space opens up, but the price is having to enter the store.   Inside, human beings scramble like beetles whose rock has been upended. Though the aisles are wide it is impossible to avoid physical contact with your fellow shoppers. It is a grotesque parody of the bazaar at Marrakech, as if dumb animals had been granted only the amount of sentience required to mock humanity. The aisles are not labeled. You must search for every item. The constant walking up and down causes a numbness that borders on profound despair. Your conscious mind registers merely annoyance, impatience.   But on a cellular level, your body cries out in weariness. The fatigue you feel is a warning: millions of years of evolution trying to save you from becoming mired in the tar, from sinking into the warm blackness and ultimately being reclaimed by the earth itself. Be sure to get the dark chocolate peanut butter cups, they are right by the register.'  https://davidkanigan.com/2021/08/03/if-werner-herzog-reviewed-trader-joes-on-yelp/"

The pastries at unincorporated are worth visiting for but get there early in the morning while there's still a selection.   When I'm in need of beans and a hot cup of regular drip coffee, I head to Jones. They have a nice space away from the bustle of old town and they do a solid job with everything on the menu. (Not to mention they have a top rated pizza joint next door!)  I see the reactions here are mixed, but I enjoy Copa Vida for the vibes and the food. (I like the coffee but I really wish I could order in a bigger size!) Stumptown has been quite a disappointment every time I've been there with high prices and an attitude from the baristas that seems to non-verbally say 'why are you here bothering me?' I know the coffee scene can be a bit uptight sometimes and it seems like they really embrace it there."

The bag of 'Awaken' beans has made good pour-overs at home though.  Has anyone tried Home Brewed Bar near the Playhouse District? It's a Filipino microroaster, and it's my next destination."

Most people who go to Mandarin get a mixed beverage/matcha beverage and not a pour over coffee.   Highlight coffee is 100x better than stumptown. I'd even put Superba there as their coffee is actually good. Intelligentsia is great for coffee. Boy and the bear should be on the list.   If you're just going for vibes or hype then I guess the list is fine.

I am making a Pasadena themed game board and need some help with the graphics. I am currently thinking of: Icons: oranges/blossoms, oak trees, green parrots, roses, crowns Font: craftsman inspired Artwork: monuments like the bridge, city hall, the rose bowl, wrigley mansion etc.  Anything I am missing??? Particularly in the icon category.   Edit: wow thank you everyone!! These are great!  I should have been more clear no people.  What I meant by icons was more like little pieces of clip art that can be used.  Love the cheese burger contribution! Sorry for the confusion there."

The air quality isn't the best as well which is why I won't stay, but LA cities aren't known for their excellent air. "

My sense is it's way more than a retrofit: they're using this as an opportunity to upgrade the building as well. Which is all well and good, but as two of our council members said when this initiative was discussed earlier in the year, we didn't have a public conversation about what infrastructure needs Pasadena has to prioritize.  $200M is a LOT of money. You could use it to replace aging city pipes (we have a lot of old ass plumbing), build a homeless shelter, hell, hire more people in the housing department just to process development plans faster. There's a ton of stuff you could do with the money that the public may feel is more important than a historic building.  And don't get me wrong: it's a gorgeous building. I loved that library. But I don't know that it's worth what will inevitably be *more* than $200M when all is said and done, largely for the privilege of preserving an old ass building.

The fact that we're already going to be spending so much gives me pause on PL - not so much because it's unworthy to have a gorgeous historic library but because you know there will be even *more* expenses in the future, and we could devote that $200M to those instead of a historic building."

At first glance, I was skeptical, as my assumption was that this was primarily a seismic retrofit project designed to preserve the historic building  certainly worthy goals but not with a $195m price tag. However, after extensive research, I've discovered that the scope of the project is far more ambitious. The plan is not just to bring the building up to modern seismic standards, but to reimagine the library as a compelling community asset for the next century.  The proposal includes reducing browsable stacks by nearly 28%, moving portions of the collection to basement-level archival spaces, and adding small-group meeting spaces, expanding the teen room by 33%, and creating gallery spaces. It's also designed to enhance public areas for community events while preserving the library's precious historic interior spaces and ornate exterior fabric. This comprehensive approach will ensure that the Central Library remains a relevant and vibrant part of Pasadena's future while honoring its past. The library will celebrate its 100th birthday in 2027, and I believe this project positions it to serve our community for another hundred years. As someone who cherishes Pasadena's historical treasures, I feel confident recommending a **'Yes' vote on Measure PL**."""

The first time I went there I knew it was going to be a big problem. Been back maybe 10 times and almost every time, either someone blocks the through-lane for people NOT using drive thru, or they miss the 2 dedicated lanes to the right that set you up for a smooth left in to menu board, and have to ride over the curb to take the sharp left. Also saw someone trying to cut in front of someone who followed procedure and left the through-lane open. Even seen a couple of drivers stopped soon after entering the lot, absolutely paralyzed and unable to solve the puzzle. Funny thing is, it's a brilliant traffic solution they engineered here.

The library where everyone visits is more of a museum, so not a good place to study, no tables.   Huntington has an entrance fee or a very reasonable membership fee. But you can access the Red Car Cafe with outside seats, the gift shop, and the large 1919 Cafe without paying the fee. To do so, when you enter do not go in the lines, go past the Red Car Cafe, toward the shop, and then right into the garden down the walkway a bit and the 1919 cafe will be on your right. (If a guard says anything just say you're going to the 1919, but they likely won't. They do check all backpacks.) There are outside and inside seats. They have tasty meals and all kinds of snacks. The pizza is a good deal, especially for museum food. There are two other entry check points, just past the 1919 and past the outside tables for Red Car.   On the weekend Huntington gets very busy, so it might be tough to find seating. Walking back toward the entrance, on the same walkway as 1919, there is an open atrium that is sometimes empty, sometimes has meetings, that's another place to check out."

It's a *research* library and is only used by people with some kind of scholarly reason to be there. People able to access the library are either *fellows* (people who have a fellowship with the Huntington) or folks like me: a *reader*, who applied to access the library's resources for research purposes.  At risk of being pedantic though, this has nothing to do with *membership.* Members are people who pay to access the Gardens. Members do *not* get access to the library, at all. Likewise, as a reader, I'm not a member: no one pays to be a reader or fellow. (Fellows and readers do get access to the Gardens however).  Personally, as someone who works in a lot of libraries around this area  just because I like getting out of the house to write  the Huntington can still work for you: there's outdoor seating by the entrance cafe and the 1919 food court has both indoor and outdoor seating. Technically, it's for people *dining* there but I know folks who use the tables there as a work space because they prefer being outside vs. indoors. Just keep in mind: *no power outlets* in case that matters to you or not.  Regardless, the Huntington wouldn't be my first suggestion for you however. Normally, I'd suggest the Pasadena Central Library but obviously, that can't work because they're still closed indefinitely. However, here are the libraries open on *Sundays* (you said ""weekend"" but most libraries are open on Saturdays; it's Sundays that are less common). In every case here, **Sunday hours are 1-5pm**.  * **Hastings branch** **of Pasadena Library**: I really like the mid-century architecture here. It's a smaller library but not normally that busy.  * **San Marino Library** **(aka Cromwell)**: Despite having worked there as a page in high school, I haven't been back here in years but after the renovation, it's much larger.  * **South Pasadena Library:** My new hometown library. It's cute/quaint. On the smaller side but they have a quiet room to the left of the entrance for people trying to work/read. * **Alhambra Civic Center Library:** Also on the larger side. The free parking lot is underneath the library."

Edited for formatting.   A.O.C.  November 7, 2024  ""I'm not here to sugarcoat what we all are about to collectively experience.  ""But I think what we can do to prepare is build community. We do not have a choice.  Our choice is to build. Our choice to continue to fight. Our choice is to win. Our choice is to have each other.  We are about to enter a political period that will have consequences for the rest of our lives.  Our main project is to unite the working class in this country against a fascist agenda. Period.  Believe it or not, building community  whether it's your church, mosque, a knitting group, your dinner circle  is far more transformative than you realize.  If you don't know your neighbor, it's time to know your neighbor.  If you have a co-worker you think you're cool with, it's time to get to know that person.  It's time to get to know the people we will be relying on to protect each other.  It may seem frivolous, but I guarantee you it's not: creating community around you is one of the most powerful and radical things you can do in an environment like this.  Sometimes even just being in community with people who are not like-minded with you  is a very odd little thing that can help change their mind.  We have no choice but to live in the times that we live in, and to make it better one day at a time, one choice at a time.  Never, ever think that any choice or act of yours is too small. It isn't.  Regimes and autocracies are taken down by millions of drops of small actions that would otherwise be invisible by masses of people.  This is the assignment that we have ahead of us. I look forward to doing this work with you all.  In solidarity,  Alexandria"""

Thank you. There's a very real reason to be worried. I implore anyone who hasn't yet read Project 2025 to do so. It's not like they're hiding their agenda. It's all spelled out in black and white on 992 pages which took me about three weeks to read. Say goodbye to how things are at this moment. Take a picture. Write down how you feel and tuck it away. There will be a point when you will wish for these good old days.   When they dismantle the department of education and you have to pay for your child to go to school while they allow private institutions to set their tuition fees you might see how great things are now. When they put conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccination pseudo-science promoter RFK Jr 'go wild' while in charge of the department of health and human services you might see how great things are now. And that's just a piece of their whole plan.   It's all there waiting for people to read.   And lastly while I'm here, to all those  who claim they voted him into office 'because the economy':   if you think a 78 year old dude with a 6x bankrupt business record is going to bring you prosperity you are a fool who put the party name and almighty dollar above all else. You have plunged us all into a full-blown Idiocracy. The 'gimme mine and fuck you' crowd deserves a round of applause.   Fortunately I've only got maybe another 20 years of life left and won't have to see Carl's JR take custody of anyone's children.   IYKYK *deuces*"

He fits your bill really well.  www.brushandsmile.com  Note, though, that in the last 5 years, most well-established dentists have ditched insurance panels entirely, except occasionally Delta Premiere.

So, good dentists who have been working long enough to establish a successful practice are mostly out-of-network at this point."
